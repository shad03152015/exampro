        "Question": "Your client Dianne approaches you for legal advice on putting up a medium-sized restaurant business. She wonders whether she should use a corporation, a single proprietorship, or a branch of an existing corporation. Briefly explain the legal advantages and disadvantages of each.",
        "Answer": "If Dianne sets up a separate corporation, her liability is limited to her subscription, but formation and operation require more paperwork. In a single proprietorship, her liability is unlimited, but there is less paperwork. If she sets up a branch of an existing corporation, the corporation has more capital, but all assets of the existing corporation are liable for the debts of the restaurant business."

        "Question": "What is the nationality of a corporation organized under foreign laws but owned 100% by Filipinos?",

        "Question": "Sierra Electronics Inc. has 100 common shares held by Filipinos and 100 non-voting preferred shares held by foreigners. Can it own land in the Philippines?",
        "Answer": "No, because to own land, a corporation must be at least 60% owned by Filipinos in terms of both voting shares and outstanding capital stock. Here, Filipinos own 100% of voting shares but only 50% of outstanding capital stock, so it does not meet the requirement."

        "Question": "In a case involving mining corporations where on paper Filipino ownership is 60%, but a foreign corporation exercises control, should the control test or grandfather rule apply?",
        "Answer": "The grandfather rule should apply because if there is doubt about beneficial ownership and control, it warrants looking through the layers of ownership. Here, the foreign corporation exercises control, so the grandfather rule is appropriate."

        "Question": "In a loan default case, J Bank sued X Corp., its President Mr. P, and Y, Inc. arguing that Mr. P is liable for signing the loan and Y, Inc. is an alter ego. Are Mr. P and Y, Inc. liable?",
        "Answer": "Mr. P is not liable because he signed as a corporate representative and there is no evidence of bad faith or gross negligence. Y, Inc. is not liable because interlocking ownership alone is not sufficient to pierce the corporate veil; there must be complete domination used to commit fraud or wrong, and proximate cause of injury, which are not present here."

        "Question": "In a trust receipt transaction, can the President of YEC avoid criminal liability for estafa by invoking the doctrine of separate juridical personality?",
        "Answer": "No, because the law makes directors and officers criminally liable for violations of trust receipt agreements, as a corporation cannot be imprisoned. However, he may not be civilly liable unless he bound himself personally."

        "Question": "Can a suit for unpaid rentals prosper against both Marulas Creative Technology Inc. and its president Y?",

        "Question": "After losing his corporate positions, stockholder S refused to return a Ford Expedition owned by the corporation, claiming ownership due to his substantial equity. Is his contention valid?",

        "Question": "What is the doctrine of 'piercing the veil of corporate entity' and under what circumstances does it apply?",
        "Answer": "It is an equitable doctrine that disregards the separate corporate personality, treating the corporation as an association of persons, making officers and stockholders directly liable. It applies when the corporate fiction is used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud, defend crime, or when the corporation is a mere alter ego, instrumentality, or business conduit of a person or another corporation."

        "Question": "How does one pierce the veil of corporate fiction?",

        "Question": "Mr. Pablo transferred all his assets to a family corporation while a lawsuit was pending against him. The sheriff could not find any property in his name. What remedy is available to the plaintiff?",
        "Answer": "The plaintiff can invoke the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, arguing the corporation was formed to avoid a just obligation, given the timing of the incorporation amidst ongoing litigation."

        "subject": "Commercial Law",
        "No": 17,
        "Question": "Define the trust fund doctrine.",
        "Answer": "The trust fund doctrine provides that subscriptions to the capital stock of a corporation constitute a fund to which creditors have a right to look for the satisfaction of their claims.

        "Answer": "Yes, 'XY' is a stock corporation because it is organized as such and its Articles of Incorporation and by-laws do not prohibit the declaration of dividends. The provision for charitable distribution upon dissolution does not affect its status as a stock corporation."

        "subject": "Commercial Law",
        "No": 20,
        "Question": "Distinguish a private corporation from a public corporation, and a stock corporation from a non-stock corporation.",
        "Answer": "A private corporation is formed for private purpose, benefit, or end, while a public corporation is created for political or public purpose connected with government administration. A stock corporation has capital stock divided into shares and may distribute dividends, while a non-stock corporation does not have capital stock and does not distribute dividends to its members."

        "Question": "Can a stock corporation legally convert to a charitable non-stock, non-profit association by amending its articles of incorporation? Would the answer be the same if it were originally a non-stock corporation?",
        "Answer": "Yes, a stock corporation can convert to a non-stock corporation by amendment, as no distribution of assets to stockholders occurs. No, the answer would not be the same if it were originally a non-stock corporation, as converting to a stock corporation would involve distributing profits to members, which requires dissolution first."

        "Question": "Can AB Memorial Foundation, a non-profit, non-stock corporation, use donated funds for disaster relief or operate a restaurant to augment its funds?",
        "Answer": "Yes, it can use funds for disaster relief if the amount is reasonable. No, it cannot operate a restaurant if its purposes are limited to maintaining a library and museum, as that would be ultra vires."
    },
    {
        "subject": "Commercial Law",
        "No": 23,
        "Question": "In a close corporation managed by stockholders, can a disgruntled stockholder demand a meeting to elect directors, and can a consumer sue all stockholders for damages without proving negligence?",
        "Answer": "No, he cannot demand an election if the articles provide for management by stockholders. Yes, the consumer can sue the stockholders personally, as they are deemed directors and are liable for corporate torts unless adequate liability insurance is obtained, and negligence need not be proven for food-related injuries."
    },
    {
        "subject": "Commercial Law",
        "No": 24,
        "Question": "In a close corporation, is a shareholder bound by a pricing proviso in the by-laws for the right of first refusal, even if the articles are silent on pricing?",
