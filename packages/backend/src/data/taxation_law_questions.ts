        "Answer": "The following doctrines, explained: a. Lifeblood Doctrine – Without revenue raised from taxation, the government will not survive, resulting in detriment to society. Without taxes, the government would be paralyzed for lack of motive power to activate and operate it. (CIR v. Algue, Inc., G.R. No. L-28896, February 17, 1988, 158 SCRA 9) b. Necessity Theory – The exercise of the power to tax emanates from necessity, because without taxes, government cannot fulfill its mandate of promoting the general welfare and well being of the people. (CIR v. Bank of Philippine Islads, G.R. No. 134062, April 17, 2007, 521 SCRA 373) c. Benefits received principle – Taxpayers receive benefits from taxes through the protection the State affords to them. For the protection they get arises their obligation to support the government through payment of taxes. (CIR v. Algue, Inc., G.R. No. L-28896, February 17, 1988, 158 SCRA 9) d. Doctrine of symbiotic relationship - Taxation arises because of reciprocal relation of protection and support between the State and taxpayers. The State gives protection and for it to continue giving protection, it must be supported by the taxpayers in the form of taxes. (CIR v. Algue, Inc., G.R. No. L-28896, February 17, 1988, 158 SCRA 9)"

        "Answer": "The principles of a sound tax system are the following: a. Fiscal adequacy which means that the sources of revenue should be sufficient to meet the demands of public expenditures; b. Equality or theoretical justice which means that the tax burden should be proportionate to the taxpayer’s ability to pay (this is the so-called ability to pay principle); and c. Administrative feasibility which means that the tax law should be capable of convenience, just and effective administration."

        "Question": "Jennifer is the only daughter of Janina who was a resident in Los Angeles, California, U.S.A. Janina died in the U.S. leaving to Jennifer one million shares of Sun Life (Philippines), Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines. Said shares were held in trust for Janina by the Corporate Secretary of Sun Life and the latter can vote the shares and receive dividends for Janina. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the U.S. taxed the shares on the ground that Janina was domiciled in the U.S. at the time of her death. [a] Can the CIR of the Philippines also tax the same shares? Explain. (2.5%) [b] Explain the concept of double taxation. (2.5%) ",
        "Answer": "(A) Yes. The property being a property located in the Philippines, it is subject to the Philippine estate tax irrespective of the citizenship or residence of the decedent (Sec. 85, NIRC). However, if Janina is a non-resident alien at the time of her death, the transmission of the shares of stock can only be taxed applying the principle of reciprocity (Sec. 104, NIRC). (8) Double taxation occurs when the same subject or object of taxation is taxed twice when it should be taxed but once. Double taxation is prohibited when it is an imposition of taxes on the same subject matter, for the same purpose, by the same taxing authority within the same jurisdiction, during the same taxing period, with the same kind or character of a tax (84 C.J.S.131-132). It is permissible if taxes are of different nature or character, or the two taxes are imposed by different taxing authorities (Villanueva v. City of Iloilo, G.R. No. L-26521, December 28,1968, 26 SCRA 578)."

        "Answer": "Double taxation in the strict sense pertains to the direct double taxation. This means that the taxpayer is taxed twice by the same taxing authority, within the same taxing jurisdiction, for the same property and same purpose. On the other hand, double taxation in broad sense pertains to indirect double taxation. This extends to all cases in which there is a burden of two or more impositions. It is the double taxation other than those covered by direct double taxation."

        "Question": "Upon his retirement, Alfredo transferred his savings derived from his salary as a marketing assistant to a time deposit with AAB Bank. The bank regularly deducted 20% final withholding tax on the interest income from the time deposit. Alfredo contends that the 20% final tax on the interest income constituted double taxation because his salary had been already subjected to withholding tax. Is Alfredo’s contention correct? Explain your answer. (3%) ",
        "Answer": "No. Double taxation means taxing for the same tax period the same thing or activity twice, when it should be taxed but once, for the same purpose and with the same kind or character of tax. (CIR v. Citytrust Investment Phils., G.R. Nos. 139786, 140857, September 27, 2006) The 20% final tax is imposed on the interest income, while the tax earlier withheld is on the salary or compensation income. Thus, though both pertain to income tax, they do not pertain to the same thing or activity and consequently, no double taxation exists."

The dividend remitted to Caruso is subject to U.S. withholding tax with respect to a non-resident alien like Caruso. A. What will be your advice to Caruso in order to lessen the impact of possible double taxation on the same income? (3%) B. Would your answer in A. be the same if Caruso became a U.S. immigrant in 2008 and had become a non-resident Filipino citizen? Explain the difference in treatment for Philippine income tax purposes. (3%)",
        "Answer": "Caruso has the option either to claim the amount of income tax withheld in U.S. as a deduction from his gross income in the Philippines, or to claim it as a tax credit (Sec. 34(C)(1)(b), NIRC). No. The income from abroad of a non-resident citizen is exempt from the Philippine income tax; hence, there is no international double taxation on said income (Sec. 23, NIRC)."

        "Question": "Lucky V Corporation (Lucky) owns a IO-storey building on a 2,000 square meter lot in the City of Makati. It sold the lot and building to Rainier. for P80 million. One month after, Rainier sold the lot and building to Healthy Smoke Company (HSC) for P200 million. Lucky filed its annual tax return and declared its gain from the sale of the lot and building in the amount of P750,000.00. An investigation conducted by the BIR revealed that two months prior to the sale of the properties to Rainier, Lucky received P40 million from HSC and not from Rainier. Said amount of P40 million was debited by HSC and reflected in its trial balance as other inv. - Lucky Bldg. The month after, another P40 million was reflected in HSC's trial balance as other inv. - Lucky Bldg. The BIR concluded that there is tax evasion since the real buyer of the properties of Lucky is HSC and not Rainier. It issued an assessment for deficiency income tax in the amount of P79 million against Lucky. Lucky argues that it resorted to tax avoidance or a tax saving device, which is allowed by the NIRC and BIR rules since it paid the correct taxes based on its sale to Rainier. On the other hand, Rainier and HSC also paid the prescribed taxes arising from the sale by Rainier to HSC. Is the BIR correct in assessing taxes on Lucky? Explain. (5%) ",
        "Answer": "Yes. The sale of the property by Lucky V Corporation (Lucky) to Rainier and consequently the sale by Rainier to HSC being prompted more on the mitigation of tax liabilities than for legitimate business purposes, therefore Constitutes tax evasion. The real buyer from Lucky is HBC as evidenced by the direct receipt of payments by the former from the latter where the latter recorded other investments — Lucky Building. The scheme of resorting to a two-step transaction in selling the property to the ultimate buyer in order to escape paying higher taxes is considered as outside of those lawful means allowed in mitigating tax liabilities which makes Lucky criminally and civilly liable. Hence, the BIR is correct in assessing taxes on Lucky (CIR v. Estate of Benigno P. Todo, Jr., G.R. No.147188, September 14, 2004, 438 SCRA 290)."

        "Question": "You are the retained tax counsel of ABC Corp. Your client informed you that they have been directly approached with a proposal by a BIR insider (i.e., a middle rank BIR official) on the tax matter they have referred to you for handling. The BIR insider’s proposal is to settle the matter by significantly reducing the assessment, but he will get 50% of the savings arising from the reduced assessment. What tax, criminal and ethical considerations will you take into account in giving your advice? Explain the relevance of each of these considerations. ",
        "Answer": "As a lawyer, I have the responsibility to give only a lawful advice. Canon I of the Code of Professional Responsibility mandates me to “uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of the land and promote respect for law and legal processes. Rule 1.01 states that “a lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.” Rule 1.02 provides that “a lawyer shall not counsel or abet activities aimed at defiance of the law or at lessening confidence in the legal system.” Therefore, I will advise my client not to agree with the proposal of the BIR officer. Agreeing with the proposal will result in criminal prosecution under the following laws: Under the NIRC, the officers of the board who authorized the tax evasion will be liable under Section 253(C), while the corporation shall be liable under Section 256. The BIR official is liable under Section 269 which provides for the violations committed by government enforcement officers. Paragraph (d) of Section 269 provides that one of these violations is “offering or undertaking to accomplish, file or submit a report or assessment on a taxpayer without the appropriate examination of the books of accounts or tax liability, or offering or undertaking to submit a report or assessment less than the amount due the Government for any consideration or compensation, or conspiring or colluding with another or others to defraud the revenues or otherwise violate the provisions of this Code.” Under the Revised Penal Code, the officers of the corporation shall be liable under Article 212 for corruption of public officials while the BIR official is liable for direct bribery. Both my client and the BIR official will also be liable under Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti- Graft and Corrupt Practices Act."

        "Question": "On August 31, 2014, Haelton Corporation (HC), thru its authorized representative Ms. Pares, sold a 16-storey commercial building known as Haeltown Building to Mr. Belly for P100 million. Mr. Belly, in turn, sold the same property on the same day to Bell Gates, Inc. (BGI) for P200 million. These two (2) transactions were evidenced by two (2) separate Deeds of Absolute Sale notarized on the same day by the same notary public. Investigations by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) showed that: (1) the Deed of Absolute Sale between Mr. Belly and BGI was notarized ahead of the sale between HC and Mr. Belly; (2) as early as May 17, 2014, HC received P40 million from BGI, and not from Mr. Belly; (3) the said payment of P40 million was recorded by BGI in its books as of June 30, 2014 as investment in Haeltown Building; and (4) the substantial portion of P40 million was withdrawn by Ms. Pares through the declaration of cash dividends to all its stockholders. Based on the foregoing, the BIR sent Haeltown Corporation a Notice of Assessment for deficiency income tax arising from an alleged simulated sale of the aforesaid commercial building to escape the higher corporate income tax rate of thirty percent (30%). What is the liability of Haeltown Corporation, if any? ",
        "Answer": "The tax planning scheme adopted by Haeltown Corporation constitutes tax evasion. According to CIR v. Estate of Benigno Toda (G.R. No. 147188, September 14, 2004), a transaction where a taxpayer made it appear that there were two sales of the property was considered “tainted with fraud.” The sole purpose of acquiring and transferring title of the property on the same day was to create a tax shelter. The sale to Mr. Belly (which is subject to individual capital gains tax) was to mislead the BIR and avoid the higher corporate income tax."

        "Question": "The doctrine of equitable recoupment allows a taxpayer whose claim for refund has prescribed to offset tax liabilities with his claim of overpayment.",
        "Answer": "True. The doctrine arose from common law allowing offsetting of a prescribed claim for refund against a tax liability arising from the same transaction on which an overpayment is made and underpayment is due. The doctrine finds no application to cases where the taxes involved are totally unrelated, and although it seems equitable, it is not allowed in our jurisdiction (CIR v. VST, 104 Phil. 1062 [1958]).

        "Question": "Enumerate the four (4) inherent limitations on taxation. Explain each item briefly. (4%) (BAR 2009)",
        "Answer": "The inherent limitations on the power to tax are: Taxation is for a public purpose. - The proceeds of the tax must be used (a) for the support of the State or (b) for some recognized objective of the government or to directly promote the welfare of the community. Taxation is inherently legislative. - Only the legislature has full discretion as to the persons, property, occupation or business to be taxed provided these are all within the State’s territorial jurisdiction. It can also finally determine the amount or rate of tax, the kind of tax to be imposed and the method of collection (1 Cooley 176184). Taxation is territorial. - Taxation may be exercised only within the territorial jurisdiction of the taxing authority (61 Am. Jur. 88). Within the territorial jurisdiction, the taxing authority may determine the place of taxation” or “ tax situs”, Taxation is subject to international comity. - This is a limitation which is founded on reciprocity designed to maintain a harmonious and productive relationships among the various states. Under international comity, a state must recognize the generally- accepted tenets of international law, among which are the principles of sovereign equality among states and of their freedom from suit without their consent, that limit the authority of a government to effectively impose taxes on a sovereign state and its instrumentalities, as well as on its property held, and activities undertaken in that capacity."

Its commercial airplanes do not operate within Philippine territory, or service passengers embarking from Philippine airports. The firm is represented in the Philippines by its general agent, Narotel. SAA sells airplane tickets through Narotel, and these tickets are serviced by SAA airplanes outside the Philippines. The total sales of airplane tickets transacted by Narotel for SAA in 2012 amounted to P10,000,000.00. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed SAA deficiency income taxes at the rate of 30% on its taxable income, finding that SAA’s airline ticket sales constituted income derived from sources within the Philippines. SAA filed a protest on the ground that the alleged deficiency income taxes should be considered as income derived exclusively from sources outside the Philippines since SAA only serviced passengers outside Philippine territory. It, thus, asserted that the imposition of such income taxes violated the principle of territoriality in taxation. Is the theory of SAA tenable? Explain. (5%) ",
        "Answer": "No. The activity which gives rise to the income is the sale of ticket in the Philippines, hence, the income from sale of tickets is an income derived from Philippine sources which is subject to the Philippine income tax. Accordingly, there is no violation of the principle of territoriality in taxation (Air Canada v. CIR, G.R. No. 169507, January 11, 2016, 778 SCRA 131)."

        "Question": "Kenya International Airlines (KIA) is a foreign corporation, organized under the laws of Kenya. It is not licensed to do business in the Philippines. Its commercial airplanes do not operate within Philippine territory, or service passengers embarking from Philippine airports. The firm is represented in the Philippines by its general agent, Philippine Airlines (PAL), a Philippine corporation. KIA sells airplane tickets through PAL, and these tickets are serviced by KIA airplanes outside the Philippines. The total sales of airline tickets transacted by PAL for KIA in 1997 amounted to P2,968,156.00. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed KIA deficiency income taxes at the rate of 35% on its taxable income, finding that KIA’s airline ticket sales constituted income derived from sources within the Philippines. KIA filed a protest on the ground that the P2,968,156.00 should be considered as income derived exclusively from sources outside the Philippines since KIA only serviced passengers outside Philippine territory. Is the position of KIA tenable? Reasons. (4%)",
        "Answer": "KIA’s position is not tenable. The revenue it derived in 1997 from sales of airplane tickets in the Philippines, through its agent PAL, is considered as income from within the Philippines, subject to the 35% tax based on its taxable income pursuant to Section 25(a)( 1) of the Tax Code of 1977. The transacting of business in the Philippines through its local sales agent, makes KIA a resident foreign corporation despite the absence of landing rights, thus, it is taxable on income derived from within. The source of an income is the property, activity or service that produced the income. In the instant case, it is the sale of tickets in the Philippines which is the activity that produced the income. KIA’s income being derived from within, is subject to Philippine income tax (CIR v. British Overseas Airways Corporation, 149 SCRA 395, [1987])."

Under the contract, Single Star shall provide managerial services for Triple Star’s Hongkong branch. All said services shall be performed in Hongkong. Is the compensation for the services of Single Star taxable as income from sources within the Philippines? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "No. Pursuant to the case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Baier-Nickel (G.R. No. 153793, August 29, 2006), the factor which determines the source of income for personal services is the place where the services were actually rendered. Since Single Star, a non-resident foreign corporation, will perform all the managerial services for Triple Star’s branch in Hong Kong, all compensation income arising from the performance of such services will be considered income from sources outside the Philippines, and therefore not subject to Philippine income tax."

        "Question": "ABCD Corporation (ABCD) is a domestic corporation with individual and corporate shareholders who are residents of the United States. For the 2nd quarter of 1983, these U.S.- based individual and corporate stockholders received cash dividends from the corporation. The corresponding withholding tax on dividend income — 30% for individual and 35% for corporate non-resident stockholders — was deducted at source and remitted to the BIR. On May 15,1984, ABCD filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue a formal claim for refund, alleging that under the RP-US Tax Treaty, the deduction withheld at source as tax on dividends earned was fixed at 25% of said income. Thus, ABCD asserted that it overpaid the withholding tax due on the cash dividends given to its non-resident stockholders in the U.S. the Commissioner denied the claim. On January 17, 1985, ABCD filed a petition with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) reiterating its demand for refund. Is the contention of ABCD Corporation correct? Why or why not? (3%)",
        "Answer": "Yes. The provision of a treaty must take precedence over and above the provisions of the local taxing statute consonant with the principle of the international comity. Tax treaties are accepted limitations to the power of taxation. Thus, the CTA should apply the treaty provision so that the claim for refund representing the difference between the amount actually withheld and paid to the BIR and the amount due and payable under the treaty, should be granted (Hawaiian-Philippine Company v. CIR, CTA Case No. 3887, May 31, 1988)."

        "Question": "Heeding the pronouncement of the President that the worsening traffic condition in the metropolis was a sign of economic progress, the Congress enacted Republic Act No. 10701, also known as An Act Imposing a Transport Tax on the Purchase of Private Vehicles. Under RA 10701, buyers of private vehicles are required to pay a transport tax equivalent to 5% of the total purchase price per vehicle purchased. RA 10701 provides that the Land Transportation Office (LTO) shall not accept for registration any new vehicles without proof of payment of the 5% transport tax. RA 10701 further provide that existing owners of private vehicles shall be required to pay a tax equivalent to 5% of the current fair market value of every vehicle registered with the LTO. However, RA 10701 exempts owners of public utility vehicles and the Government from the coverage of the 5% transport tax. A group of private vehicle owners sue on the ground that the law is unconstitutional for contravening the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. Rule on the constitutionality and validity of RA 10701. (5%) ",
        "Answer": "RA 10701 is valid and constitutional. A levy of tax is not unconstitutional because it is not intrinsically equal and uniform in its operation. The uniformity rule does not prohibit classification for purposes of taxation. (British American Tobacco v. Jose Isidro N. Camacho, G.R. No. 163583, April 15, 2009) Uniformity of taxation, like the kindred concept of equal protection, merely requires that all subjects or objects of taxation, similarly situated, are to be treated alike both in privileges and liabilities. Uniformity does not forfend classification as long as: (1) the standards that are used therefor are substantial and not arbitrary, (2) the categorization is germane to achieve the legislative purpose, (3) the law applies, all things being equal, to both present and future conditions, and (4) the classification applies equally well to all those belonging to the same class. (Rufino R. Tan v. Ramon R. Del Rosario, Jr., G.R. Nos. 109289, October 3, 1994, 237 SCRA 324). All of the foregoing requirements of a valid classification having been met and those which are singled out are a class in themselves, there is no violation of the “Equal Protection Clause” of the Constitution."

        "Answer": "a. Yes, but only on the leased portion. Article XIV, Section 4(3) of the 1987 Constitution provides that the assets of a non-stock, non-profit educational institution shall be exempt from taxes and duties only if the same are used actually, directly, and exclusively for educational purposes. The test of exemption from taxation is the use of the property for purposes mentioned in the Constitution. The leased portion of the building may be subject to real property tax since such lease is for commercial purposes, thereby, it removes the asset from the property tax exemption granted under the Constitution. (CIR v. De La Salle University, Inc., G.R. Nos. 196596, 198841, 198941, November 9, 2016) b.

The Municipal Assessor assessed Mr. Amado for real property taxes on the land and the warehouse. Mr. Amado objected to the assessment, contending that he should not be asked to pay realty taxes on the land since it is municipal property. Was the assessment proper? ",
        "Answer": "The assessment was proper. Under Section 217 of the LGC, real property shall be classified, valued and assessed on the basis of its actual use regardless of where located, whoever owns it, and whoever uses it. A related and complementary provision is Section 234(a) of the LGC which provides that a real property owned by the Republic of the Philippines or any of its political subdivisions is exempt from realty taxes, except when the beneficial use thereof has been granted, for consideration or otherwise, to a taxable person. In the given problem, Mr. Amado, as lessee of the land owned by the Municipality, is the actual user of the land and is liable for the realty taxes. Therefore, the assessment was proper."

        "Question": "LLL is a government instrumentality created by Executive Order to be primarily responsible for integrating and directing all reclamation projects for the National Government. It was not organized as a stock or a non-stock corporation, nor was it intended to operate commercially and compete in the private market. By virtue of its mandate, LLL reclaimed several portions of the foreshore and offshore areas of the Manila Bay, some of which were within the territorial jurisdiction of Q City. Certificates of title to the reclaimed properties in Q City were issued in the name of LLL in 2008. In 2014, Q City issued Warrants of Levy on said reclaimed properties of LLL based on the assessment for delinquent property taxes for the years 2010 to 2013. A) Are the reclaimed properties registered in the name of LLL subject to real property tax? B) Will your answer be the same in (A) if from 2010 to the present time, LLL is leasing portions of the reclaimed properties for the establishment and use of popular fastfood restaurants J Burgers, G Pizza, and K Chicken? ",
        "Answer": "A. The reclaimed properties are not subject to real property tax because LLL is a government instrumentality. Instrumentality refers to any agency of the National Government, not integrated within the department framework vested with special functions or jurisdiction by law, endowed with some if not all corporate powers, administering special funds, and enjoying operational autonomy, usually through a charter. Under the law, real property owned by the Republic of the Philippines (Republic) is exempt from real property tax unless the beneficial use thereof has been granted to a taxable person. When the title of the real property is transferred to LLL, the Republic remains the owner of the real property. Thus, such arrangement does not result in the loss of the tax exemption. B. No. As a rule, properties owned by the Republic of the Philippines are exempt from real property tax except when the beneficial use thereof has been granted, for consideration or otherwise, to a taxable person. LLL leased out portions of the reclaimed properties to a taxable entity, such as the popular fastfood restaurant, hence the reclaimed properties are subject to real property tax."

        "Question": "The Philippine-British Association, Inc. (Association) is a non-stock, non-profit organization which owns the St. Michael's Hospital (Hospital). Sec. 216 in relation to Sec. 215 of the LGC classifies all lands, buildings and other improvements thereon actually, directly, and exclusively used for hospitals as special. A special classification prescribes a lower assessment than a commercial classification. Within the premises of the Hospital, the Association constructed the St. Michael's Medical Arts Center (Center) which will house medical practitioners who will lease the spaces therein for their clinics at prescribed rental rates. The doctors who treat the patients confined in the Hospital are accredited by the Association. The City Assessor classified the Center as commercial instead of special on the ground that the Hospital owner gets income from the lease of its spaces to doctors who also entertain out-patients. Is the City Assessor correct in classifying the Center as commercial? Explain. (5%) ",
        "Answer": "No. The Medical Arts Center is an integral part of the Hospital and should be classified for assessment purposes as special. The fact alone that the doctors holding clinics in the Center are those duly accredited by the Association who owns the Hospital, and these doctors are the ones who can treat the Hospital’s patients confined in it, takes away the said Medical Arts Center from being categorized as commercial since a tertiary hospital is required by law to have a pool of physicians who comprise the required medical departments in various medical fields (City Assessora Cebu City v. Association of Benevola de Cebu, Inc., G.R. No. 152904, June 2007, 524 SCRA 128)."

It has been held that “in areas of social and economic policy, a statutory classification that neither proceeds along suspect lines nor infringes constitutional rights must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification”. Under the rational basis test, it is sufficient that the legislative classification is rationally related to achieving some legitimate State interest (British American Tobacco v.

He goes to court to assail the validity of the ordinance for being discriminatory. Decide with reasons. (3%)",

Equality and uniformity in local taxation means that all subjects or objects of taxation belonging to the same class shall be taxed at the same rate within the territorial jurisdiction of the taxing authority or local government unit and not necessarily in comparison with other units although belonging to the same political subdivision. In fine, uniformity is required only within the geographical limits of the taxing authority. It is not for the Court to judge what particular cities or municipalities should be empowered to impose occupation tax.

        "Answer": "No. Since Hopeful Corporation exercised its right to redeem the property, Generous Bank is not liable to pay capital gains tax on the foreclosure sale.

        "Answer": "Yes. Advertising expenses are generally considered as ordinary and necessary expenses. An expense is ordinary when it is commonly incurred in the trade or business of the taxpayer considering the nature of the business and the practices in the industry.

One month after, Rainier sold the lot and building to Healthy Smoke Company (HSC) for P200 million. Lucky filed its annual tax return and declared its gain from the sale of the lot and building in the amount of P750,000.00. An investigation conducted by the BIR revealed that two months prior to the sale of the properties to Rainier, Lucky received P40 million from HSC and not from Rainier. Said amount of P40 million was debited by HSC and reflected in its trial balance as 'other inv. - Lucky Bldg.' The month after, another P40 million was reflected in HSC's trial balance as 'other inv. - Lucky Bldg.' The BIR concluded that there is tax evasion since the real buyer of the properties of Lucky is HSC and not Rainier. It issued an assessment for deficiency income tax in the amount of P79 million against Lucky. Lucky argues that it resorted to tax avoidance or a tax saving device, which is allowed by the NIRC and BIR rules since it paid the correct taxes based on its sale to Rainier. On the other hand, Rainier and HSC also paid the prescribed taxes arising from the sale by Rainier to HSC. Is the BIR correct in assessing taxes on Lucky? Explain. (5%) ",
        "Answer": "Yes. The sale of the property by Lucky V Corporation (Lucky) to Rainier and consequently the sale by Rainier to HSC being prompted more on the mitigation of tax liabilities than for legitimate business purposes, therefore Constitutes tax evasion. The real buyer from Lucky is HBC as evidenced by the direct receipt of payments by the former from the latter where the latter recorded 'other investments — Lucky Building'. The scheme of resorting to a two-step transaction in selling the property to the ultimate buyer in order to escape paying higher taxes is considered as outside of those lawful means allowed in mitigating tax liabilities which makes Lucky criminally and civilly liable. Hence, the BIR is correct in assessing taxes on Lucky (CIR v. Estate of Benigno P. Todo, Jr., G.R. No.147188, September 14, 2004, 438 SCRA 290)."

        "Question": "The Philippine-British Association, Inc. (Association) is a non-stock, non-profit organization which owns the St. Michael's Hospital (Hospital). Sec. 216 in relation to Sec. 215 of the LGC classifies all lands, buildings and other improvements thereon actually, directly, and exclusively used for hospitals as 'special'. A special classification prescribes a lower assessment than a commercial classification. Within the premises of the Hospital, the Association constructed the St. Michael's Medical Arts Center (Center) which will house medical practitioners who will lease the spaces therein for their clinics at prescribed rental rates. The doctors who treat the patients confined in the Hospital are accredited by the Association. The City Assessor classified the Center as 'commercial' instead of 'special' on the ground that the Hospital owner gets income from the lease of its spaces to doctors who also entertain out-patients. Is the City Assessor correct in classifying the Center as 'commercial?' Explain. (5%) ",
        "Answer": "No. The Medical Arts Center is an integral part of the Hospital and should be classified for assessment purposes as “special”. The fact alone that the doctors holding clinics in the Center are those duly accredited by the Association who owns the Hospital, and these doctors are the ones who can treat the Hospital’s patients confined in it, takes away the said Medical Arts Center from being categorized as “commercial” since a tertiary hospital is required by law to have a pool of physicians who comprise the required medical departments in various medical fields (City Assessora Cebu City v. Association of Benevola de Cebu, Inc., G.R. No. 152904, June 2007, 524 SCRA 128)."
