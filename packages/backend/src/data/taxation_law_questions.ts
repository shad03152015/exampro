        "Question": "Briefly explain the following doctrines: lifeblood doctrine; necessity theory; benefits received principle; and doctrine of symbiotic relationship. (5%) ",
        "Answer": "The following doctrines, explained: a. Lifeblood Doctrine – Without revenue raised from taxation, the government will not survive, resulting in detriment to society. Without taxes, the government would be paralyzed for lack of motive power to activate and operate it. (CIR v. Algue, Inc., G.R. No. L-28896, February 17, 1988, 158 SCRA 9) b. Necessity Theory – The exercise of the power to tax emanates from necessity, because without taxes, government cannot fulfill its mandate of promoting the general welfare and well being of the people. (CIR v. Bank of Philippine Islads, G.R. No. 134062, April 17, 2007, 521 SCRA 373) c. Benefits received principle – Taxpayers receive benefits from taxes through the protection the State affords to them. For the protection they get arises their obligation to support the government through payment of taxes. (CIR v. Algue, Inc., G.R. No. L-28896, February 17, 1988, 158 SCRA 9) d. Doctrine of symbiotic relationship - Taxation arises because of reciprocal relation of protection and support between the State and taxpayers. The State gives protection and for it to continue giving protection, it must be supported by the taxpayers in the form of taxes. (CIR v. Algue, Inc., G.R. No. L-28896, February 17, 1988, 158 SCRA 9)"

        "Question": "Explain the principles of a sound tax system. ",
        "Answer": "The principles of a sound tax system are the following: a. Fiscal adequacy which means that the sources of revenue should be sufficient to meet the demands of public expenditures; b. Equality or theoretical justice which means that the tax burden should be proportionate to the taxpayer’s ability to pay (this is the so-called ability to pay principle); and c. Administrative feasibility which means that the tax law should be capable of convenience, just and effective administration."

        "Question": "Jennifer is the only daughter of Janina who was a resident in Los Angeles, California, U.S.A. Janina died in the U.S. leaving to Jennifer one million shares of Sun Life (Philippines), Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines. Said shares were held in trust for Janina by the Corporate Secretary of Sun Life and the latter can vote the shares and receive dividends for Janina. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the U.S. taxed the shares on the ground that Janina was domiciled in the U.S. at the time of her death. [a] Can the CIR of the Philippines also tax the same shares? Explain. (2.5%) [b] Explain the concept of double taxation. (2.5%) ",
        "Answer": "(A) Yes. The property being a property located in the Philippines, it is subject to the Philippine estate tax irrespective of the citizenship or residence of the decedent (Sec. 85, NIRC). However, if Janina is a non-resident alien at the time of her death, the transmission of the shares of stock can only be taxed applying the principle of reciprocity (Sec. 104, NIRC). (8) Double taxation occurs when the same subject or object of taxation is taxed twice when it should be taxed but once. Double taxation is prohibited when it is an imposition of taxes on the same subject matter, for the same purpose, by the same taxing authority within the same jurisdiction, during the same taxing period, with the same kind or character of a tax (84 C.J.S.131-132). It is permissible if taxes are of different nature or character, or the two taxes are imposed by different taxing authorities (Villanueva v. City of Iloilo, G.R. No. L-26521, December 28,1968, 26 SCRA 578)."

        "Question": "Differentiate between double taxation in the strict sense and in a broad sense and give an example of each. ",
        "Answer": "Double taxation in the strict sense pertains to the direct double taxation. This means that the taxpayer is taxed twice by the same taxing authority, within the same taxing jurisdiction, for the same property and same purpose. On the other hand, double taxation in broad sense pertains to indirect double taxation. This extends to all cases in which there is a burden of two or more impositions. It is the double taxation other than those covered by direct double taxation."

        "Question": "Upon his retirement, Alfredo transferred his savings derived from his salary as a marketing assistant to a time deposit with AAB Bank. The bank regularly deducted 20% final withholding tax on the interest income from the time deposit. Alfredo contends that the 20% final tax on the interest income constituted double taxation because his salary had been already subjected to withholding tax. Is Alfredo’s contention correct? Explain your answer. (3%) ",
        "Answer": "No. Double taxation means taxing for the same tax period the same thing or activity twice, when it should be taxed but once, for the same purpose and with the same kind or character of tax. (CIR v. Citytrust Investment Phils., G.R. Nos. 139786, 140857, September 27, 2006) The 20% final tax is imposed on the interest income, while the tax earlier withheld is on the salary or compensation income. Thus, though both pertain to income tax, they do not pertain to the same thing or activity and consequently, no double taxation exists."

        "Question": "In 2009, Caruso, a resident Filipino citizen, received dividend income from a U.S.-based corporation which owns a chain of Filipino restaurants in the West Coast, U.S.A. The dividend remitted to Caruso is subject to U.S. withholding tax with respect to a non-resident alien like Caruso. A. What will be your advice to Caruso in order to lessen the impact of possible double taxation on the same income? (3%) B. Would your answer in A. be the same if Caruso became a U.S. immigrant in 2008 and had become a non-resident Filipino citizen? Explain the difference in treatment for Philippine income tax purposes. (3%)",
        "Answer": "Caruso has the option either to claim the amount of income tax withheld in U.S. as a deduction from his gross income in the Philippines, or to claim it as a tax credit (Sec. 34(C)(1)(b), NIRC). No. The income from abroad of a non-resident citizen is exempt from the Philippine income tax; hence, there is no international double taxation on said income (Sec. 23, NIRC)."

        "Question": "Lucky V Corporation (Lucky) owns a IO-storey building on a 2,000 square meter lot in the City of Makati. It sold the lot and building to Rainier. for P80 million. One month after, Rainier sold the lot and building to Healthy Smoke Company (HSC) for P200 million. Lucky filed its annual tax return and declared its gain from the sale of the lot and building in the amount of P750,000.00. An investigation conducted by the BIR revealed that two months prior to the sale of the properties to Rainier, Lucky received P40 million from HSC and not from Rainier. Said amount of P40 million was debited by HSC and reflected in its trial balance as other inv. - Lucky Bldg. The month after, another P40 million was reflected in HSC's trial balance as other inv. - Lucky Bldg. The BIR concluded that there is tax evasion since the real buyer of the properties of Lucky is HSC and not Rainier. It issued an assessment for deficiency income tax in the amount of P79 million against Lucky. Lucky argues that it resorted to tax avoidance or a tax saving device, which is allowed by the NIRC and BIR rules since it paid the correct taxes based on its sale to Rainier. On the other hand, Rainier and HSC also paid the prescribed taxes arising from the sale by Rainier to HSC. Is the BIR correct in assessing taxes on Lucky? Explain. (5%) ",
        "Answer": "Yes. The sale of the property by Lucky V Corporation (Lucky) to Rainier and consequently the sale by Rainier to HSC being prompted more on the mitigation of tax liabilities than for legitimate business purposes, therefore Constitutes tax evasion. The real buyer from Lucky is HBC as evidenced by the direct receipt of payments by the former from the latter where the latter recorded other investments — Lucky Building. The scheme of resorting to a two-step transaction in selling the property to the ultimate buyer in order to escape paying higher taxes is considered as outside of those lawful means allowed in mitigating tax liabilities which makes Lucky criminally and civilly liable. Hence, the BIR is correct in assessing taxes on Lucky (CIR v. Estate of Benigno P. Todo, Jr., G.R. No.147188, September 14, 2004, 438 SCRA 290)."

        "Question": "You are the retained tax counsel of ABC Corp. Your client informed you that they have been directly approached with a proposal by a BIR insider (i.e., a middle rank BIR official) on the tax matter they have referred to you for handling. The BIR insider’s proposal is to settle the matter by significantly reducing the assessment, but he will get 50% of the savings arising from the reduced assessment. What tax, criminal and ethical considerations will you take into account in giving your advice? Explain the relevance of each of these considerations. ",
        "Answer": "As a lawyer, I have the responsibility to give only a lawful advice. Canon I of the Code of Professional Responsibility mandates me to “uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of the land and promote respect for law and legal processes. Rule 1.01 states that “a lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.” Rule 1.02 provides that “a lawyer shall not counsel or abet activities aimed at defiance of the law or at lessening confidence in the legal system.” Therefore, I will advise my client not to agree with the proposal of the BIR officer. Agreeing with the proposal will result in criminal prosecution under the following laws: Under the NIRC, the officers of the board who authorized the tax evasion will be liable under Section 253(C), while the corporation shall be liable under Section 256. The BIR official is liable under Section 269 which provides for the violations committed by government enforcement officers. Paragraph (d) of Section 269 provides that one of these violations is “offering or undertaking to accomplish, file or submit a report or assessment on a taxpayer without the appropriate examination of the books of accounts or tax liability, or offering or undertaking to submit a report or assessment less than the amount due the Government for any consideration or compensation, or conspiring or colluding with another or others to defraud the revenues or otherwise violate the provisions of this Code.” Under the Revised Penal Code, the officers of the corporation shall be liable under Article 212 for corruption of public officials while the BIR official is liable for direct bribery. Both my client and the BIR official will also be liable under Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti- Graft and Corrupt Practices Act."

        "Question": "On August 31, 2014, Haelton Corporation (HC), thru its authorized representative Ms. Pares, sold a 16-storey commercial building known as Haeltown Building to Mr. Belly for P100 million. Mr. Belly, in turn, sold the same property on the same day to Bell Gates, Inc. (BGI) for P200 million. These two (2) transactions were evidenced by two (2) separate Deeds of Absolute Sale notarized on the same day by the same notary public. Investigations by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) showed that: (1) the Deed of Absolute Sale between Mr. Belly and BGI was notarized ahead of the sale between HC and Mr. Belly; (2) as early as May 17, 2014, HC received P40 million from BGI, and not from Mr. Belly; (3) the said payment of P40 million was recorded by BGI in its books as of June 30, 2014 as investment in Haeltown Building; and (4) the substantial portion of P40 million was withdrawn by Ms. Pares through the declaration of cash dividends to all its stockholders. Based on the foregoing, the BIR sent Haeltown Corporation a Notice of Assessment for deficiency income tax arising from an alleged simulated sale of the aforesaid commercial building to escape the higher corporate income tax rate of thirty percent (30%). What is the liability of Haeltown Corporation, if any? ",
        "Answer": "The tax planning scheme adopted by Haeltown Corporation constitutes tax evasion. According to CIR v. Estate of Benigno Toda (G.R. No. 147188, September 14, 2004), a transaction where a taxpayer made it appear that there were two sales of the property was considered “tainted with fraud.” The sole purpose of acquiring and transferring title of the property on the same day was to create a tax shelter. The sale to Mr. Belly (which is subject to individual capital gains tax) was to mislead the BIR and avoid the higher corporate income tax."

        "Question": "The doctrine of equitable recoupment allows a taxpayer whose claim for refund has prescribed to offset tax liabilities with his claim of overpayment.",
        "Answer": "True. The doctrine arose from common law allowing offsetting of a prescribed claim for refund against a tax liability arising from the same transaction on which an overpayment is made and underpayment is due. The doctrine finds no application to cases where the taxes involved are totally unrelated, and although it seems equitable, it is not allowed in our jurisdiction (CIR v. VST, 104 Phil. 1062 [1958]).

        "Question": "Enumerate the four (4) inherent limitations on taxation. Explain each item briefly. (4%) (BAR 2009)",
        "Answer": "The inherent limitations on the power to tax are: Taxation is for a public purpose. - The proceeds of the tax must be used (a) for the support of the State or (b) for some recognized objective of the government or to directly promote the welfare of the community. Taxation is inherently legislative. - Only the legislature has full discretion as to the persons, property, occupation or business to be taxed provided these are all within the State’s territorial jurisdiction. It can also finally determine the amount or rate of tax, the kind of tax to be imposed and the method of collection (1 Cooley 176184). Taxation is territorial. - Taxation may be exercised only within the territorial jurisdiction of the taxing authority (61 Am. Jur. 88). Within the territorial jurisdiction, the taxing authority may determine the place of taxation” or “ tax situs”, Taxation is subject to international comity. - This is a limitation which is founded on reciprocity designed to maintain a harmonious and productive relationships among the various states. Under international comity, a state must recognize the generally- accepted tenets of international law, among which are the principles of sovereign equality among states and of their freedom from suit without their consent, that limit the authority of a government to effectively impose taxes on a sovereign state and its instrumentalities, as well as on its property held, and activities undertaken in that capacity."

        "Question": "Sure Arrival Airways (SAA) is a foreign corporation, organized under the laws of the Republic of Nigeria. Its commercial airplanes do not operate within Philippine territory, or service passengers embarking from Philippine airports. The firm is represented in the Philippines by its general agent, Narotel. SAA sells airplane tickets through Narotel, and these tickets are serviced by SAA airplanes outside the Philippines. The total sales of airplane tickets transacted by Narotel for SAA in 2012 amounted to P10,000,000.00. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed SAA deficiency income taxes at the rate of 30% on its taxable income, finding that SAA’s airline ticket sales constituted income derived from sources within the Philippines. SAA filed a protest on the ground that the alleged deficiency income taxes should be considered as income derived exclusively from sources outside the Philippines since SAA only serviced passengers outside Philippine territory. It, thus, contends that it is not liable for income tax from sources within the Philippines. Rule on the protest.",
        "Answer": "The protest should be denied. The income from the sale of tickets in the Philippines is considered as income from sources within the Philippines. The sale of tickets is the activity that produces the income. The flow of wealth occurred within Philippine territory, enjoying the protection of the Philippine government. Therefore, SAA is subject to Philippine income tax on the income derived from its ticket sales in the Philippines. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. British Overseas Airways Corporation, G.R. No. L-65773, April 30, 1987)."
