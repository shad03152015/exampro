  "Question": "The Supreme Court suspended Atty. Irish for one year in an administrative case filed against her for Gross Misconduct. During the effectivity of her suspension, Janet appointed her as attorney-in-fact in an execution sale arising from a civil case that she previously handled. At the execution sale, Atty. Irish took part in the bidding and negotiations as regards the payment of the judgment award. Atty. Elvie, the opposing counsel in the civil case, questioned the appearance by Atty. Irish during the execution sale because of her suspension. Atty. Irish argued that she was merely acting as attorney-in-fact of Janet, which was not tantamount to the practice of law. Do you agree with Atty. Irish? Explain your answer.",
  "Answer": "No, I do not agree with Atty. Irish. While the practice of law is generally defined as any activity in or out of court which requires the application of law, legal procedure, knowledge, training, and experience, the enumeration of prohibited practices during suspension is expanded. The appearance of Atty. Irish as attorney-in-fact during the execution sale, taking part in the bidding and negotiations, constitutes an activity that requires the use of legal knowledge, training, and experience, and is thus considered practicing law. A lawyer is prohibited from practicing law during suspension."

  "Question": "You are the counsel for Boni and Klyde, who are accused as co-conspirators in a Murder case. During arraignment, they both pleaded not guilty. In the course of the trial, Klyde confessed to you that it was actually Boni who committed the Murder and that he merely helped Boni dispose of the body. Klyde tells you that he wants to plead guilty and directs you to inform the prosecution and the judge that he wants to testify against Boni as a state witness. Can you continue to represent Boni, or Klyde, or both? Explain briefly.",
  "Answer": "I can no longer represent Klyde. The reason for my disqualification to continue to represent Klyde has to do with his status as a state witness. Assuming Klyde complies with the requirements to be discharged as a state witness, the Prosecutor's Office shall represent him. As for Boni, I can continue to represent the latter."

  "Question": "While attending a wedding, a lawyer got to dance with and talk to another guest who ended up sharing details of their marital problems. When asked by the guest, the lawyer explained the distinctions among legal separation, annulment, declaration of nullity, and divorce. The lawyer went on to not only extend advice, but even map out a strategy on how the guest's marital woes could be addressed. The matters discussed by the lawyer - is it a privileged communication?",
  "Answer": "The lawyer's advice is covered by the privileged communication rule. This is because matters disclosed by a prospective client to a lawyer are protected by the rule on privileged communication for the prospective client to feel free to discuss whatever they wish with the lawyer without fear that what they tell the lawyer will be divulged or used against them."

  "Question": "A seafarer filed a complaint for disbarment against his former lawyer for compromising his labor case without his knowledge and written authorization. He was surprised to learn that his case was already dismissed upon a monetary settlement. The seafarer, however, failed to receive any amount from the settlement. Does the seafarer have legal grounds to file the complaint? Explain briefly.",
  "Answer": "Yes. The seafarer has legal grounds to file the complaint. First, a lawyer cannot compromise a client's litigation, or receive anything in discharge of a client's claim, without a special power of attorney (SPA) for such purpose. Second, a lawyer shall, during the existence of the lawyer-client relationship, account for and prepare an inventory of any fund or property belonging to the client, whether received from the latter or from a third person, immediately upon such receipt."

  "Answer": "The answer must be qualified. The prayer for the return of the P50,000.00 acceptance fee may prosper because a lawyer shall deliver the funds and property of his client when due or upon demand, and the fee must be returned since he failed to provide the legal service he was hired to do. The prayer for the return of the P300,000.00 personal loan may also prosper. A lawyer must account for and return money or property of a client upon demand; a loan is payable, and the lawyer's failure to pay is a violation of the trust reposed on him."

  "Question": "The Cultural Heritage Association of Manila filed an injunction case to stop the construction of a 40-storey condominium building owned by XYZ Corp., a well-known real estate developer. Eventually, the injunction case was dismissed with finality by Judge T, and an entry of judgment was issued. Two (2) years later, Judge T bought condominium units in the same 40-storey building owned by XYZ Corp. Did Judge T commit an ethical violation? Explain.",
  "Answer": "No, Judge T did not commit an ethical violation. Article 1491 of the Civil Code prohibits judges from acquiring property that is the subject of litigation, but the prohibition applies only if the property is acquired during the pendency of the litigation. Since Judge T acquired the condominium units two years after the case was dismissed with finality and an entry of judgment was issued, the prohibition does not apply."

  "Question": "Distinguish compulsory from voluntary inhibition of judges.",
  "Answer": "Compulsory prohibition (or inhibition) - A judge cannot sit in any case where he, his wife, or child, is pecuniarily interested as heir, legatee, creditor, or otherwise, or is related to either party within the sixth degree of consanguinity or affinity, or to counsel within the fourth degree, or in which he has been executor, administrator, guardian, trustee or counsel, or in which he has presided in any inferior court when his ruling is the subject of review. This requires the written consent of all parties to be waived. Voluntary inhibition occurs when judges, in the exercise of sound discretion, may disqualify themselves from sitting in a case for just and valid reasons other than those specified by law."

I declare fealty to the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines. I shall work for the ends of justice, based on law and the principles of freedom, love, equality, and peace.

I shall not knowingly or unjustly favor nor prejudice anyone, nor shall I pervert the law to unjustly favor or prejudice anyone.

He claimed that the power to tax is essentially a legislative function. Rule on the validity of Atty. Celis' contention and state the obligations, if any, under the Rules of Court and the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) that Atty. Celis may have violated.",
  "Answer": "Validity of Contention - Atty. Celis’ contention that his profession should not be taxed is not proper because the privilege to practice law is subject to regulation by the Supreme Court and requires membership and financial support of every attorney as a condition sine qua non. Atty. Celis violated the rule that a lawyer shall at all times uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession and support the activities of the Integrated Bar."

  "Answer": "The defense is not proper since it is immaterial that the acts complained of were committed before they were admitted to the bar. The possession of good moral character is both a condition precedent for admission to the bar and a continuing condition to remain a member of the legal profession. Admission creates only a rebuttable presumption of qualifications, which may be refuted even after admission."

Interested applicants may submit applications to Branch XXX, RTC of Camarines Sur. The screening of some applicants was also conducted in the Judge's office. What provisions, if any, of the Code of Judicial Conduct did Judge Camarin violate?",
  "Answer": "Judge Camarin violated the Code of Judicial Conduct. He misused his judicial office and lent the prestige of the judicial office to advance the private interests of others (his family's restaurant business). This violates the Canon on Propriety, which requires judges to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety in all their activities"

  "Question": "In a case pending before the Sandiganbayan, the Sandiganbayan justices themselves actually took part in the questioning of a defense witness and the accused. More importantly, the questions of the justices were in the nature of cross-examinations characteristic of confrontation, probing, and insinuation. Is this manner of questioning proper? ",
  "Answer": "No, this manner of questioning is not proper. Although a trial judge has the right to question witnesses to clarify material points, this right should be sparingly and judiciously used. When the questions are cross-examining, confrontational, probing, and insinuating, the judge risks acting as both prosecutor and judge, effectively depriving the defense of its right to due process."

  "Question": "Dr. Cielo filed a disbarment case against Ciguerra for posting on his FB account, sexist, vulgar, and obscene comments, and language disrespectful of women in his FB posts. Ciguerra’s defense is that his FB posts were private remarks on his private FB account and only meant to be shared among his FB friends, and Dr. Cielo was not part of them. He also claimed that the disbarment case was filed in violation of his constitutionally-guaranteed right to privacy. The Court, however, found that Ciguerra’s FB account did not have privacy settings. Can Ciguerra be disbarred for the series of posts in his FB account against Dr. Cielo?",
  "Answer": "Yes, Ciguerra can be disbarred. A lawyer is bound to observe proper decorum at all times, be it in his public or private life. He must behave in a manner befitting an officer of the court. The words used were unbecoming of an officer of the law. His defense regarding privacy is invalid, especially since his account lacked privacy settings, making his posts accessible to the public."

Can you accept the prosecution's offer to turn state witness?",
  "Answer": "I cannot accept the prosecution's offer to turn state witness. The information I acquired involving the criminal case against Gregory is covered by the privileged communication rule. I must decline to testify and provide evidence against the defendants as the attorney-client privilege lasts even beyond the termination of the relationship."

The two of them agreed on a success fee for Atty. Hamilton of P50,000.00 plus 500 square meters of the land. The trial court ultimately rendered judgment in favor of Gener, and the judgment became final and executory. After receiving P50,000.00, Atty. Hamilton demanded the transfer to him of the promised 500 square meters of the land. Is the refusal of Gener to comply with the demand justified? Explain.",
  "Answer": "No, the refusal is not justified. Article 1491 of the Civil Code prohibits lawyers from acquiring property or rights subject of litigation, but this prohibition applies only during the pendency of litigation. Since the judgment became final and executory before Atty. Hamilton acquired the portion of the property, the acquisition is valid."

Such agreement is against public policy, especially if the attorney agrees to carry on the action at his own expense in consideration of some bargain to have part of the thing in dispute.

Rule on Atty. Simplicio's contentions.",
  "Answer": "Contention (a) is not tenable. The advertisement suggests a specific legal specialty and creates an unjustified expectation, which is improper. Contention (b) is not tenable.

It is a general lien, available to secure payment of the lawyer's fees in all cases handled for the client. It is a passive lien; the lawyer holds the property. Charging Lien: A lien upon all judgments for payment of a sum of money and executions thereof, to ensure payment of his fees and disbursements in the said case. It is a special lien.

Since Judge Andres was present when Hazel handed the ring to Constantino, he was compelled by his wife to testify as a witness for the prosecution in the criminal case. Did the judge commit any violation of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary? Explain.",
  "Answer": "Yes. A judge should refrain from volunteering information to the court or testifying as a witness in a proceeding where the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned. If the judge’s testimony is necessary, he should consider compulsory inhibition if related to the parties or counsel. Although the judge may not be compulsorily disqualified, voluntarily testifying may compromise the appearance of impartiality."

Atty. Alfonso. filed a complaint for disbarment against Atty. Harold for violation of the sub judice rule and Canon 11 of the CPR. Explain the sub judice rule and rule on the disbarment case.",
  "Answer": "The sub judice rule restricts comments and disclosures pertaining to judicial proceedings in order to avoid prejudging the issue, influencing the court, or obstructing the administration of justice. The disbarment case against Atty. Harold should prosper. Atty.

  "Answer": "Yes, Judge D committed an act of impropriety. A judge should not volunteer information to the court or testify as a witness in a proceeding where the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned.

Jactar dared Medroso to sue, bragged about his connections with the courts, and even uttered veiled threats... Under these facts, list and justify the potential objections that can be made against Jactar’s admission to the practice of law.",
  "Answer": "The potential objection is the absence of good moral character (Rules of Court, Rule 138, Sec. 2). Good moral character requires that a person should not have acted in a manner that violated private and social duties, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between persons. Jactar's recklessness, hit-and-run conduct, boasting of court connections, and veiled threats demonstrate a lack of such character."

In his application to take the 1997 Bar Examinations, A did not disclose the above incident. Is he qualified to take the Bar Examinations?",
  "Answer": "A's failure to disclose disqualifies him. Rule 7.01 of the CPR provides that 'a lawyer shall be answerable for knowingly making a false statement or suppressing a material fact in connection with their application for admission to the bar'. It is the fact of concealment, and not the commission of the crime itself (even if it does not involve moral turpitude or was amicably settled), that makes him morally unfit to become a lawyer."

Atty. Yabang was subsequently sued for illegal practice of law. Would the case prosper? Explain.",
