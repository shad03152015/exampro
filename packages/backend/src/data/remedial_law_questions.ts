        "Question": "Amorsolo, a Filipino citizen permanently residing in New York City, filed with the RTC of Lipa City a Complaint for Rescission of Contract of Sale of Land against Brigido, a resident of Barangay San Miguel, Sto. Tomas, Batangas. The subject property, located in Barangay Talisay, Lipa City, has an assessed value of P19,700.00. Appended to the complaint is Amorsolo’s verification and certification of non-forum shopping executed in New York City, duly notarized by Mr. Joseph Brown, Esq., a notary public in the State of New York. Brigido filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the following grounds: [A] The court cannot acquire jurisdiction over the person of Amorsolo because he is not a resident of the Philippines; xxx ",
        "Answer": "The first ground raised lacks merit because jurisdiction over the person of a plaintiff is acquired by the court upon the filing of plaintiffs complaint therewith. Residency or citizenship is not a requirement for filing a complaint, because plaintiff thereby submits to the jurisdiction of the court."

        "Question": "Angelina sued Armando before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila to recover the ownership and possession of two parcels of land; one situated in Pampanga, and the other in Bulacan.  (A) May the action prosper? Explain.",
        "Answer": "NO, the action may not prosper, because under Rep. Act No. 7691, exclusive original jurisdiction in civil actions which involve title to, or possession of real property or any interest therein is determined on the basis of the assessed value of the land involved, whether it should be P20,OOO in the rest of the Philippines, outside of the Manila with courts of the first level or with the-Regional Trial Court. The assessed value of the parcel of land in Pampanga is different from the assessed value of the land in Bulacan. What is involved is not merely a matter of venue, which is waivable, but of a matter of jurisdiction. However, the action may prosper if jurisdiction is not in issue, because venue can be waived."

(2009 Bar Question) (B) Will your answer be the same if the action was for foreclosure of the mortgage over the two parcels of land? Why or why not?",
        "Answer": "NO, the answer would not be the same. The foreclosure action should be brought in the proper court of the province where the land or any part thereof is situated, either in Pampanga or in Bulacan. Only one foreclosure action need be filed unless each parcel of land is covered by distinct mortgage contract. In foreclosure suit, the cause of action is for the violation of the terms and conditions of the mortgage contract; hence, one foreclosure suit per mortgage contract violated is necessary."

        "Question": "Goodfeather Corporation, through its President, Al Pakino, filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) a complaint for specific performance against Robert White. Instead of filing an answer to the complaint, Robert White filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground of lack of the appropriate board resolution from the Board of Directors of Good feather Corporation to show the authority of Al Pakino to represent the corporation and file the complaint in its behalf. The RTC granted the motion to dismiss and, accordingly it ordered the dismissal of the complaint. Al Pakino filed a motion for reconsideration which the RTC denied. As nothing more could be done by Al Pakino before the RTC, he file an appeal before the Court of Appeals (CA). Robert White moved for dismissal of the appeal in the ground that the same involved purely a question of law and should have been filed with the Supreme Court (SC). However, Al Pakino claimed that the appeal involved mixed questions of fact and law because there must be a factual determination if, indeed, Al Pakino was duly authorized by Goodfeather Corporation to file the complaint. Whose position is correct? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Al Pakino is correct in claiming that the appeal involved mixed questions of fact and law. There is a question of law when the doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on a certain state of facts. On the other hand, there is a question of fact, when the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of alleged facts. (Mirant Philippines Corporation v. Sario, G.R. No. 197598, November 21, 2012). Since the complaint was dismissed due to the alleged lack of appropriate board resolution from the Board of Directors of Goodfeather Corporation, the appeal will necessarily involve a factual determination of the authority to file the Complaint for the said Corporation. Hence, the appeal before the Court of Appeals is correct."

        "Question": "The Ombudsman, after conducting the requisite preliminary investigation, found probable cause to charge Gov. Matigas in conspiracy with Carpinter, a private individual, for violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act (RA) No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, as amended). Before the information could be filed with the Sandiganbayan, Gov. Matigas was killed in an ambush. This, notwithstanding, an information was filed against Gov. Matigas and Carpintero. At the Sandiganbayan, Carpintero through counsel, filed a Motion to Quash the information, on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, arguing that with the death of Gov. Matigas, there is no public officer charged in the information. Is the Motion to Quash legally tenable? ",
        "Answer": "NO. The Motion to quash is not legally tenable. While it is true that by reason of the death of Gov. Matigas, there is no longer any public officer with whom he can be charge for violation of R.A. 3019, it does not mean, however, that the allegation of conspiracy between them can no longer be proved or that their alleged conspiracy is already expunged. The only thing extinguished by the death of Gov. Matigas is his criminal liability. His death did not extinguish the crime nor did it remove the basis of the charge of conspiracy between him and Carpintero. The requirement before a private person may be indicated for violation of Section 3(q) of R.A. 3019, among others, is that such private person must be alleged to have acted in conspiracy with a public officer. The law, however, does not require that such person must, in all instances, be indicated together with the public officer. Indeed, it is not necessary to join all alleged co-conspirators in an indictment for conspiracy (People of the Philippines v. Henry T. Go, G.R. No. 168539, March 25, 2014)."

        "Question": "What trial court outside Metro Manila has exclusive original jurisdiction over the following cases? Explain briefly your answers.  (a) An action filed on November 13, 2017 to recover the possession of an apartment unit being occupied by the defendant by mere tolerance of the plaintiff, after the former ignored the last demand to vacate that was duly served upon and received by him on July 6, 2016. ",
        "Answer": "It depends. The instant action is an action publiciana considering that more than a year has lapsed from the date of last demand (Natalia Realty, Inc. v. CA, G.R. No. 126462, November 12, 2002; Penta Pacific Realty Corporation v. Ley Construction and Development Corporation, G.R. No. 161589, November 24,2014). Thus, if the assessed value of the apartment unit does not exceed P20,000.00, the Municipal Trial Court has the exclusive original jurisdiction over the action (Penta Pacific Realty Corporation, supra; BP Big. 129, Sec. 33). On the other hand, if the assessed value of the apartment unit exceeds P20,000.00, the Regional Trial Court has the exclusive original jurisdiction over the action (Penta Pacific Realty Corporation, supra; BP Big. 129, Sec. 19). The allegation of the assessed value of the apartment unit must be found in the complaint, otherwise the action should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the trial court is not thereby afforded the means of determining from the allegations of the pleading whether jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action pertains to it or to another court (Penta Pacific Realty Corporation, supra)."

(b) A complaint in which the principal relief sought is the enforcement of a seller’s contractual right to repurchase a lot with an assessed value of P15,000.00. ",
        "Answer": "The Regional Trial Court has the jurisdiction over an action in which the principal relief sought is the enforcement of a seller’s contractual right to repurchase a lot. Since said action is one for specific performance to enforce a contractual right, it is incapable of pecuniary estimation and therefore cognizable by the Regional Trial Court (Surviving Heirs of Bautista v.

Unknown to the parties, the case was inadvertently raffled to an RTC designated as a special commercial court. Later, the RTC rendered judgment adverse to Era, who, upon realizing that the trial court was not a regular RTC, approaches you and wants you to file a petition to have the judgment annulled for lack of jurisdiction. What advice would you give to Era? Explain your answer. (4%) ",
        "Answer": "I will advise Era that a petition to have the judgment annulled for lack of jurisdiction has no basis. In Gonzales v. GJH Land, Inc. (G.R. No. 202664, November 10, 2015), the Supreme Court ruled that the fact that a particular branch which has been designated as a Special Commercial Court does not shed the RTC’s general jurisdiction over ordinary civil cases under the imprimatur of statutory law, i.e. Batas Pambansa Big. 129. The designation of Special Commercial Court was merely intended as a procedural tool to expedite the resolution of commercial cases in line with the court’s exercise of jurisdiction. This designation was not made by statute but only by an internal Supreme Court rule under its authority to promulgates rules governing matters of procedure."

        "Question": "To recover possession, Estrella filed a complaint for ejectment with the Municipal Trial Court (MTC), alleging that she is the true owner of the land as evidenced by her certificate of title and tax declaration which showed the assessed value of the property as P21,000.00. On the other hand, John refuted Estrella’s claim of ownership and submitted in evidence a Deed of Absolute Sale between him and Estrella. After the filing of John’s answer, the MTC observed that the real issue was one of ownership and not of possession. Hence, the MTC dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal by Estrella to the Regional Trial Court (RTC), a full-blown trial was conducted as if the case was originally filed with it. The RTC reasoned that based on the assessed value of the property, it was the court of proper jurisdiction. Eventually, the RTC rendered a judgment declaring John as the owner of the land and, hence, entitled to the possession thereof.  a. Was the MTC correct in dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction? Why or why not?",
        "Answer": "The Metropolitan Trial Court was not correct in dismissing the Complaint for lack of jurisdiction. It is well settled that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations contained in the complaint. The contention of defendant in his Motion to Dismiss has nothing to do in the determination of jurisdiction. Otherwise, jurisdiction would become dependent almost entirely upon the whims of the defendant (Medical Plaza Makati Condominium v. Cullen, G.R. No. 181416, November 11, 2013). Relative thereto, the Municipal Trial Courts have exclusive original jurisdiction over cases of forcible entry and unlawful detainer (Section 33, B.P. 129). Hence, the Metropolitan Trial Court is not correct in dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. Besides, the rules allow provisional determination of ownership in ejectment cases when the defendant raises the defense of ownership in his pleadings and the question of possession cannot be resolved without deciding the issue of ownership (Sec. 16, Rule 70). Accordingly, the inferior courts have jurisdiction to resolve questions of ownership whenever it is necessary to decide the question of possession in an ejectment case. (Serreno v. Spouses Gutierrez, G.R. No. 162366, November 10, 2006)."

The Family Court issued a 30-day TPO against Romeo. A day before the expiration of the TPO, Juliet filed a motion for extension. Romeo in his opposition raised, among others, the constitutionality of R.A. No. 9262 (The VAWC Law) arguing that the law authorizing the issuance of a TPO violates the equal protection and due process clauses of the 1987 Constitution. The Family Court judge, in granting the motion for extension of the TPO, declined to rule on the constitutionality of R.A. No. 9262. The Family Court judge reasoned that Family Courts are without jurisdiction to pass upon constitutional issues, being a special court of limited jurisdiction and R.A. No. 8369, the law creating the Family Courts, does not provide for such jurisdiction. Is the Family Court judge correct when he declined to resolve the constitutionality of R.A. No. 9262? ",

No. 179267, June 25, 2013, the Supreme Court held that the “Family Courts have authority and jurisdiction to resolve the constitutionality of a statute.

        "Question": "Pedro and Juan are resident of Barangay Ifurug, Municipality of Dupaci Mountain Province. Pedro owes Juan the amount of P50,000,00. Due to non-payment. Juan brought his complaint to the Council of Elders of said barangay which implements the bodong justice system. Both appeared before the council where they verbally agreed that Pedro will pay in installments on specific due dates. Pedro reneged on his promise. Juan filed a complaint for sum of money before the Municipal Trial Court (MTC). Pedro filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground that the case did not pass through the barangay conciliation under R.A. No. 7160 and that the RTC, not the MTC, has jurisdiction. In his opposition, Juan argued that the intervention of the Council of Elders is substantial compliance with the requirement of R.A. No. 7160 and the claim of P50,000.00 is clearly within the jurisdiction of the MTC. As MTC judge, rule on the motion and explain. ",
        "Answer": "The Motion to Dismiss should be denied. As a general rule, no complaint involving any matter within the authority of the Lupon shall be instituted or filed directly in court for adjudication unless there has been a confrontation between the parties in the barangay and no settlement was reached section 412(a) of Republic Act No. 7160; April Wolf, G. Martinez, G.R. No.162084, June 28, 2005). However, in barangays where majority of the inhabitants are members of indigenous cultural communities, local systems of settling disputes through their councils of datus or elders shall be recognized without prejudice to the applicable provisions of the Local Government Code (Sections 399, R.A. 7160). As a consequence, the customs and traditions of indigenous cultural communities shall be applied in settling disputes between members of the cultural communities Sections 412, R.A. 7160), thus, the confrontation between Pedro and Juan before the Council of Elders of their barangay is sufficient compliance with the precondition for filing the case in court under Section 412 of R.A. No. 7160 (Zamora y Heirs of Izquierdo, G.R. No.146195, November 18, 2004). Be that as it may, it is well-settled that the mode of enforcement of an amicable settlement under the Katarungan Pambarangay Law does not rule out the right of rescission under Art. 2041 of the Civil Code (Crisanta Miguel v. Montanez,G.R. No.191336, January 25,2014). Accordingly, Juan filed a complaint for sum Of money in the MTC, he is deemed to have rescinded the compromise agreement reached before theCouncil of Elders of the barangay. Henceforth. Pedro is incorrect in alleging that the RTC, not the MTC has jurisdiction over Juan's claim. Considering that the claim is only for P50,000.00, the case is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the MTC under B.P. Big. 129 and may proceed pursuant to AM. No. 08-8-7-SC or the \"Rules of Procedure for Small Claims Cases.\" Notably, a motion to dismiss is among the prohibited pleadings under Section 14(a) of said rules. Similarly, Juan’s claim of P50,000.00 may be governed by the 1991 Rules on Summary Procedure which clearly falls within the jurisdiction of the MTC, ergo, the motion to dismiss based on lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter should be denied (Section 19(a)1 1991 Rules on Summary Procedure)."

Still later, Borrower obtained a P300,000.00 loan secured by a real estate mortgage on his land valued at P500,000.00. Borrower defaulted on his payments when the loans matured. Despite demand to pay the P500,000.00 loan, Borrower refused to pay. Lender, applying the totality rule, filed against Borrower with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, a collection suit for P500,000.00. Did Lender correctly apply the totality rule and the rule on joinder of causes of action? ",
        "Answer": "YES. The Lender correctly applied the totality rule and the rule on joinder of causes of action because where the claims in all the causes of action are principally for recovery of sum of money, the aggregate amount of the claim shall be the test of jurisdiction (Section 5(d), Rule 2). Here, the total amount of the claim is P500,000.00. Hence, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila has jurisdiction over the suit. At any rate, it is immaterial that one of the loans is secured by a real estate mortgage because the Lender opted to file a collection of sum of money instead of foreclosure of the said mortgage."

In opposing the motion of Elise to dismiss the second action on the ground of splitting of a single cause of action, Merchant Bank armed that the ground relied upon by Elise was devoid of any legal basis considering that the two actions were based on separate contracts, namely, the contract of loan evidenced by the promissory note, and the deed of real estate mortgage.

If the applicant for exemption meets the salary and property requirements under Section 19 of Rule 141, then the grant of the application is mandatory.

The Motion shall be referred to the Executive Judge for immediate action in case of multi-sala courts. If the motion is granted by the Executive Judge, the case shall be raffled off or assigned to the court designated to hear small claims cases.

Thus, on July 1, 2013, King Kong filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) an action for rescission of contract with damages and payment of accrued rentals as of June 30, 2013.  a. Can Kin II Chong move to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the RTC is without jurisdiction since the amount claimed is only P300,000.00?",
        "Answer": "NO. Kin II Chong cannot move to dismiss the Complaint. An action for rescission of contract with damages and payment of accrued rentals is considered incapable of pecuniary estimation and therefore cognizable by the Regional Trial Court.

        "Question": "Prince Chong entered into a lease contract with King Kong over a commercial building where the former conducted his hardware business. The lease contract stipulated, among others, a monthly rental of P50,000.00 for a four (4) – year period commencing on January 1, 2010. On January 1, 2013, Prince Chong died.

If the rentals accrued during the lifetime of Prince Chong, and King Kong also filed the complaint for sum of money during that time, will the action be dismissible upon Prince Chong’s death during the pendency of the case?",
        "Answer": "NO. The action will not be dismissible upon Prince Chong’s death during the pendency of the case. When the action is for recovery of money arising from contract, and defendant dies before entry of final judgment in the court in which the action was pending at the time of such death, it shall not be dismissed but shall instead be allowed to continue until entry of final judgment. A favorable judgment obtained by the plaintiff shall be enforced under Rule 86 (Sec. 20, Rule 3). Relative thereto, since the complaint for sum of money filed by King Kong survives the death of Prince Chong, the case shall not be dismissed and the Court shall merely order the substitution of the deceased defendant.

        "Question": "Eduardo, a resident of the City of Manila, filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila a complaint for the annulment of a Deed of Real Estate Mortgage he signed in favor of Galaxy Bank (Galaxy), and the consequent foreclosure and auction sale on his mortgaged Makati property. Galaxy filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground of improper venue alleging that the complaint should be filed with the RTC of Makati since the complaint involves the ownership and possession of Eduardo’s lot. Resolve the motion with reasons. ",
        "Answer": "The Motion to dismiss should be granted. An action for nullification of the mortgage documents and foreclosure of the mortgaged property is a real action that affects the title to the property; thus, venue of the real action is before the court having jurisdiction over the territory in which the property lies (Jimmy T. Go v. United Coconut Planters Bank, GR. No. 156187, November 11, 2004; Chua v. Total Office Products & Services, G.R. No. 152808, September 30, 2005). In Fortune Motors v. Court of Appeals (ER. No. 112191, February 7,1997), The Supreme Court also held that an action to annul a foreclosure sale of a real estate mortgage is no different from an action to annul a private sale of real property. While it is true that petitioner does not directly seek the recovery of title or possession of the property in question, his action for annulment of sale and his claim for damages are closely intertwined with the issue of ownership of the building which, under the law, is considered immovable property, the recovery of which is petitioner’s primary objective. The prevalent doctrine is that an action for the annulment or rescission of a sale of real property does not operate to efface the fundamental and prime objective and nature of the case, which is to recover said real property. It is a real action (Paglaum Management & Development Corporation v. Union Bank of the Philippines, G.R. No.179018, June 18, 2012). Being a real action, it shall be commenced and tried in the proper court which has jurisdiction over the area where the real property involved, or a portion thereof, is situated (Section 1, Rule 4, Rules of Court). The complaint should be filed in the RTC of Makati where the mortgaged property is.situated."

Thus, the court dismissed outright the petition for lack of jurisdiction.  a. Was the court correct in motu proprio dismissing the petition?",
        "Answer": "NO. The court was not correct in motu proprio dismissing the petition. While it appears that the alleged actionable neglect or omission took place in the City of Z of Province II and, therefore cognizable by the RTC of Province II, nonetheless, venue is not jurisdictional, and it can be waived in a special civil action for continuing mandamus (Dolot v.

Ten years before his retirement, he bought for cash in his name a house and lot in Malate, Manila. Six months after his return, he learned that his house and lot were the subject of foreclosure proceedings commenced by ABC Bank on the basis of a promissory note and a deed of real estate mortgage he had allegedly executed in favor of ABC Bank five years earlier. Knowing that he was not in the country at the time the promissory note and deed of mortgage were supposedly executed, Evan forthwith initiated a complaint in the RTC of Manila praying that the subject documents be declared null and void. ABC Bank filed a motion to dismiss Evan’s complaint on the ground of improper venue on the basis of a stipulation in both documents designating Quezon City as the exclusive venue in the event of litigation between the parties arising out of the loan and mortgage. Should the motion to dismiss of ABC Bank be granted? Explain your answer.  ",
        "Answer": "No. ABC Bank’s motion to dismiss should be denied. In Briones v. Court of Appeals (GR. No. 204444, January 14, 2015), the Supreme Court ruled that a complaint directly assailing the validity of the written instrument itself should not be bound by the exclusive venue stipulation contained therein and should be filed in accordance with the general rules on venue. The Supreme Court ruled that it would be inherently inconsistent for a complaint of this nature to recognize the exclusive venue stipulation when it, in fact, precisely assails the validity of the instrument in which such stipulation is contained. In this case, Evan’s complaint directly assails the validity of the promissory note and deed of mortgage, which contains said venue stipulation; hence, said venue stipulation is not binding on him. Evan correctly filed his complaint with the Manila RTC pursuant to Rule 4 of the Rules of Court."

Salvador promptly filed his answer, and included a counterclaim for P250,000.00 arising from the allegedly baseless and malicious claims of Abraham that compelled him to litigate and to engage the services of counsel, and thus caused him to suffer mental anguish. Noting that the amount of the counterclaim was below the exclusive original jurisdiction of the RTC, Abraham filed a motion to dismiss vis-a-vis the counterclaim on that ground. Should the counterclaim of Salvador be dismissed? Explain your answer. (4%) ",
        "Answer": "No, Salvador’s counterclaim is compulsory in nature, and thus should not be dismissed. Section 7, Rule 6 of the Rules of Court defines a compulsory counterclaim as any claim for money or any relief, which a defending party may have against an opposing party, which at the time of suit arises out of, or is necessarily connected with, the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff’s complaint (Rungcayao v. Fort Ilocandia, G.R. No. 170483, April 19,2010). A counterclaim is compulsory where: 1. It arises out of or is necessarily connected with the transaction or occurrence that is the subject flatter of the opposing party’s claim; 2. It does not require the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction, and; 3. The trial court has jurisdiction to entertain the claim (Spouses Arenas v. CA, G.R. No. 126640, November 23, 2000). Regarding the trial court’s jurisdiction, Section 7, Rule 6 of the Rules of Court explicitly states that in an original action before the Regional Trial Court, the counterclaim may be considered compulsory regardless of the amount. In relation thereto, the Supreme Court held in Alday v. FGU Insurance Corp. (G.R, No. 138822, January 23, 2001), that claims for damages, allegedly suffered as a result of plaintiff’s filing of a complaint, are compulsory. In this case, the court’s jurisdiction over Salvador’s counterclaim, despite being below the jurisdictional amount is evident from the following: Salvador’s claims for litigation expenses arise out of Abraham’s complaint for damages; Salvador’s claims do not require the presence of third parties; and being compulsory in nature, the trial court may exercise jurisdiction over said claim."

Moreover a verification is merely a formal and not a jurisdictional requirement. The court should not dismiss the case but merely require the party concerned to rectify the defect.

Upon receipt of the RTC’s order granting execution pending appeal, Ms. Dumpty filed with the CA another case, this time a special civil action for certiorari assailing said RTC order. Is there a violation of the rule against forum shopping considering that two (2) actions emanating from the same case with the RTC were filed by Ms. Dumpty with the CA? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "NO. There is no violation of the rule against forum shopping. The essence of forum shopping is the filing by a party against whom an adverse judgment has been rendered in one forum, seeking another and possibly favorable opinion in another suit other than by appeal or special civil action for certiorari; the act of filing of multiple suits involving the same parties for the same cause of action, either simultaneously or successively for the purpose of obtaining a favorable judgment. Forum shopping exists where the elements of litis pendentia are present or where a final judgment in one case will amount to res judicata in the action under consideration (Roberto S. Benedicto v. Manuel Laeson, G.R. No. 141508, May 5, 2010). In Philippines Nails and Wires Corporation v. Malayan Insurance Company, Inc., G.R. No. 143933, February 14, 2003, the Supreme Court held that one party may validly question a decision in a regular appeal and at the same time assail the execution pending appeal via certiorari without violating the rule against forum shopping. This is because the merits of the case will not be addressed in the Petition dealing with the execution and vice versa. Since Ms. Dumpty merely filed a special civil action for certiorari, the same will not constitute a violation of the rules on forum shopping because the resolution or a favorable judgment thereon will not amount to res judicata in the subsequent proceedings between the same parties.

In an unverified answer, Harold specifically denied the genuineness of the promissory note. During the trial, Harold sought to offer the testimonies of the following: (1) the testimony of an NBI handwriting expert to prove the forgery of his signature; and (2) the testimony of a credible witness to prove that if ever Harold had executed the note in favor of Ramon, the same was not supported by a consideration. May Ramon validly object to the proposed testimonies? Give a brief explanation of your answer.  ",
        "Answer": "Ramon may validly object to the proposed testimony of the NBI handwriting expert. The alleged promissory note attached to Ramon’s complaint is an actionable document since it is a written instrument upon which an action or defense is grounded (Asian Construction and Development Corporation v. Mendoza, G.R. No. 176949, June 27, 2012). Accordingly, Harold’s failure to specifically deny under oath the genuineness of said actionable document amounts to an implied admission of its genuineness and due execution under Rule 8, Section 8 of the Rules of Court. Harold cannot thus raise the defense of forgery by presenting the testimony of a handwriting expert. Well-settled is the rule that the trial court may reject evidence that a party adduces to contradict a judicial admission he previously made since such admission is conclusive as to him (Equitable Card Network Inc., v. Capistrano, G.R. No. 180157, February 8, 2012). However, Ramon may not validly object to the testimony of a credible witness to prove that the promissory note was not supported by a consideration. The admission of the genuineness and due execution of a document does not bar the defense of want of a consideration (Hibberd v. Rohde and McMillan, G.R. No, L-8414, December 9, 1915)."

        "Question": "On August 13, 2008, A, as shipper and consignee, loaded on the M/V Atlantis in Legaspi City 100,000 pieces of Century eggs. The shipment arrived in Manila totally damaged on August 14, 2008. A filed before the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC)of Manila a complaint against B Super Lines, Inc. (B Lines), owner of the M/V Atlantis, for recovery of damages amounting to P167,899. He attached to the complaint the Bill of Lading. x x x B. The MeTC denied the Motion in question A. B Lines thus filed an Answer raising the defense that under the Bill of Lading it issued to A, its liability was limited to P10, 000. At the pre-trial conference, B Lines defined as one of the issues whether the stipulation limiting its liability to P10, 000 binds A. A countered that this was no longer in issue 11.S B Lines had jailed to deny under oath the Bill of Lading. Which of the parties is correct? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "The Contention of B is correct: A’s contention is wrong. It was A who pleaded the Bill of Lading as an actionable document where the stipulation limits B’s liability to A to P10, 000.00 only. The issue raised by B does not go against or impugn the genuineness and due execution of the Bill of Lading as an actionable document pleaded by A, but invokes the binding effect of said stipulation. The oath is not required of B, because the issue raised by the latter does not impugn the genuineness and due execution of the Bill of Lading."

        "Question": "Modesto sued Ernesto for a sum of money, claiming that the latter owed him PI- million, evidenced by a promissory note, quoted and attached to the complaint. In his answer with counterclaim, Ernesto alleged that Modesto coerced him into signing the promissory note, but that it is Modesto who really owes him PL5- million. Modesto filed an answer to Ernesto’s counterclaim admitting that he owed Ernesto, but only in the amount of PO.5-million. At the pretrial, Modesto marked and identified Ernesto’s promissory note. He also marked and identified receipts covering payments he made to Ernesto, to the extent of PO.5-million, which Ernesto did not dispute. After pre-trial, Modesto filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, while Ernesto filed a motion for summary judgment on his counterclaim. Resolve the two motions with reasons. ",
        "Answer": "Modesto’s motion for judgment on the pleadings should be denied. While it is true that under the actionable document rule, Ernesto’s failure to deny under oath the promissory note in his answer amounted to an implied admission of its genuineness and due execution, his allegation in his answer that he was coerced into signing the promissory note tendered an issue which should be tried. The issue of coercion is not inconsistent with the due execution and genuineness of the instrument. Thus, Ernesto’s failure to deny the genuineness of the promissory note cannot be considered a waiver to raise the issue that he was coerced in signing the same. Said claim of coercion may also be proved as an exception to the Parol Evidence Rule. On the other hand, Ernesto’s motion for summary judgment may be granted. Modesto’s answer to Ernesto’s counterclaim — that he owed the latter a sum less than what was claimed — amounted to an admission of a material fact and if the amount thereof could summarily be proved by affidavits, deposition, etc., without the need of going to trial, then no genuine issue of fact exists."

        "Question": "Circe filed with the RTC a complaint for the foreclosure of real estate mortgage against siblings Scylla and Charybdis, co-owners of the property and co-signatories to the mortgage deed. The siblings permanently reside in Athens, Greece. Circe tipped off Sheriff Pluto that Scylla is on a ballkbayan trip and is billeted at the Century Plaza Hotel in Pasay City. Sheriff Pluto went to the hotel and personally served Scylla the summons, but the latter refused to receive summons for Charybdis as she was not authorized to do so. Sheriff Pluto requested Scylla for the email address and fax number of Charybdis which the latter readily gave. Sheriff Pluto, in his return of the summons, stated that \"Summons for Scylla was served personally as shown by her signature on the receiving copy of the summons. Summons on Charybdis was served pursuant to the amendment of Rule 14 by facsimile transmittal of the summons and complaint on defendant's fax number as evidenced by transmission verification report automatically generated by the fax machine indicating that it was received by the fax number to which it was sent on the date and time indicated therein.\" Circe, sixty (60) days after her receipt of Sheriff Pluto's return, filed a Motion to Declare Charybdis in default as Charybdis did not file any responsive pleading.  a. Should the court declare Charybdis in default?",
        "Answer": "NO, the court should not declare Charybdis in default because there was no proper service of summons. Section 12, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court applies only to a foreign private juridical entity that is not registered in the Philippines and has no resident agent in the country, and not to individuals (A.M. No. 11-3-6-SC, March 15, 2011). The service of summons by facsimile under said rule is, therefore, defective. A foreclosure of real estate mortgage is a quasi in rem action, thus, the court can render judgments as long as it has jurisdiction over the res and any of the modes of extra- territorial service of summons under Section 15 of Rule 14 is complied with prior leave of court. There is, unfortunately, no showing in the problem that a prior leave of court was obtained before resorting to extra-territorial service of summons; hence, the service of summons is defective."

The caretaker is a high school graduate and is the godson of Roberto. Believing the caretaker's story to be true, Sheriff Matinik left a copy of the summons and complaint with the caretaker. Was there a valid substituted service of summons? Discuss the requirements for a valid service of summons. ",
        "Answer": "No. There was no valid substituted service of summons. In an action strictly in personam, personal service on the defendant is the preferred mode of service, that is, by handing a copy of the summons to the defendant in person. If defendant for excusable reasons, cannot be served with the summons within a reasonable period, then substituted service can be resorted to. While substituted service of summons is permitted, it is extraordinary in character and in derogation of the usual method of service; hence, it must faithfully and strictly comply with the prescribed requirements and circumstances authorized by the rules. Compliance with the rules regarding the service of summons is as important as the issue of due process for the Court to acquire jurisdiction. For the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty to apply, the Sheriff’s Return must show that serious efforts or attempts were exerted to personally serve the summons and that said efforts failed. These facts must be Specifically narrated in the Return. It must clearly show that the substituted service must be made on a person of suitable age and discretion living in the dwelling or residence of defendant; otherwise, the Return is flawed and the presumption cannot be availed of. The Supreme Court laid down the requirements as follows: Impossibility of prompt personal service, i.e., the party relying on substituted service or the sheriff must show that defendant cannot be served promptly or there is impossibility of prompt service within a reasonable time. Reasonable time being \"so much time as is necessary under the circumstances for a reasonably prudent and diligent man to do, conveniently, what the contract or duty requires that should be done, having a regard for the rights and possibility of loss, if any to the other party\". Moreover, it must be indicated therein that the sheriff has made several attempts at personal service for at least three (3) times on at least two (2) different dates. Specific details in the return, i.e., the sheriff must describe in the Return of Summons the facts and circumstances surrounding their attempted personal service.

No. 130974, August 16, 2006). Otherwise stated, it is only when the defendant cannot be served personally within a reasonable time that a substituted service may be made. Impossibility of prompt service should be shown by stating the efforts made to find the defendant personally and the fact that such efforts failed. This statement should be made in the proof of service (Galura v. Math-Agro Corporation, G.R. No. 167230, August 14, 2009).

He claims that the action filed by Tristan is an action in personam and that the court did not acquire jurisdiction over defendants Arthur King and/or his estate. On the other hand, Tristan claims that the suit is an action in rem or at least an action quasi in rem. Is the RTC judge correct in ordering service of summons by publication? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Yes, the RTC judge is correct in ordering service of summons by publication. Under Section 15 Rule 14 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, extraterritorial service, which includes service by publication, may be availed of in actions the subject of which is property within the Philippines in which the defendant has or claims a lien or interest or in which the relief demanded consists in excluding the defendant from any interest therein. In this case, the action for reconveyance has for its subject a real property in the Philippines in the defendant’s name and in which the relief sought is to annul the defendant’s title and vest it in the plaintiff. Although the action for reconveyance is in personam (Republic v. CA, 315 SCRA 600, 606), the test of whether an action is covered by Section 15 Rule 14 is not its technical characterization as in rem or quasi in rem but whether it is among those mentioned in S15 R14.

In an Order received by Jose on January 5, 2015, the trial court denied the Motion to Dismiss. On February 4, 2015, Jose sought reconsideration of that Order through a Motion for Reconsideration. Miguel opposed the Motion for Reconsideration on the ground that it was filed out of time. Jose countered that the 15- day rule under Section 1 of Rule 52 does not apply where the Order sought to be reconsidered is an interlocutory order that does not attain finality. Is Jose correct?

The 15-day period to file a motion for reconsideration under Section 1 of Rule 52 refers to a motion for reconsideration of a judgment or final resolution or order. In this case, what is involved is an order denying a motion to dismiss, which is not a final order as it does not terminate the case. The order is simply an interlocutory order which may be reconsidered by the trial court at any time during the pendency of the case. [See Rasdas v. Estenor, 13 Dec 2005].

Realizing a jurisdictional error in filing the complaint in the RTC, Agatha filed a notice of dismissal before she was served with the answer of Yana. The RTC issued an order confirming the dismissal. Three months later, Agatha filed another complaint against Yana based on the same cause of action this time in the MeTC of Makati City. However, for reasons personal to her, Agatha decided to have the complaint dismissed without prejudice by filing a notice of dismissal prior to the service of the answer of Yana. Hence, the case was dismissed by the MeTC. A month later, Agatha reified the complaint against Yana in the same MeTC. May Yana successfully invoke the Two-Dismissal Rule to bar Agatha's third complaint? Explain your answer.  ",
        "Answer": "No, Yana cannot successfully invoke the Two-Dismissal Rule. In order for the Two-Dismissal Rule to apply, Rule 17, Section 1 of the Rules of Court requires that both dismissals through plaintiff's notices were made by a competent court. Moreover, in Ching Cheng (G.R. No. 175507, October 8, 2014), the Supreme Court ruled that the following requisites should concur for the Two-Dismissal Rule to apply: a. There was a previous case that was dismissed by a competent court; b. Both cases were based on or include the same claim; c. Both notices for dismissal were filed by the plaintiff; and d. When the motion to dismiss filed by the plaintiff was consented to by the defendant on the ground that the latter paid and satisfied all the claims of the former. In this case, the Makati City RTC had no jurisdiction over the first complaint which was dismissed through Agatha's notice, because it is below its jurisdictional amount of at least P400,000.00. Therefore, the Two-Dismissal Rule cannot be successfully invoked in this case."

As despite demands, Mercedes failed to make good the check, Benjamin filed in January 2009 a complaint for collection of sum of money before the RTC of Dayao. Mercedes filed in February 2009 her Answer with Counterclaim, alleging that before the filing of the case, she and Benjamin had entered into a dacion enpago agreement in which her vintage P1, 000,000 Rolex watch which was taken by Benjamin for sale on commission was applied to settle her indebtedness; and that she incurred expenses in defending what she termed a \"frivolous lawsuit.. She accordingly prayed for P50, 000 damages. A. Benjamin soon after moved for the dismissal of the case. The trial court accordingly dismissed the complaint. And it also dismissed the Counterclaim. Mercedes moved for a reconsideration of the dismissal of the Counterclaim. Pass upon Mercedes' motion. (2010 Bar Question)",
        "Answer": "Mercedes' Motion for Reconsideration is impressed with merit: the trial court should not have dismissed her counter-claim despite the dismissal of the Complaint. Since it was the plaintiff (Benjamin) who moved for the dismissal of his Complaint, and at a time when the defendant (Mercedes) had already filed her Answer thereto and with counterclaim, the .dismissal of the Complaint should not carry with it the dismissal of the counterclaim without the conformity of the defendant-counterclaimant.

        "Answer": "The motion may be denied since trial had already commenced and two witnesses for the plaintiff had already testified.

Trade secrets may not be the subject of compulsory disclosure by reason of their confidential and privileged character.

BB's counsel objected on the ground that the prosecutor has not conducted a competency examination on the witness, a requirement before the rule cited can be applied in the case. x x x After the prosecution had rested its case, BB' s counsel filed with leave a demurrer to evidence, seeking the dismissal of the case on the ground that the prosecutor failed to present any evidence on BB' s minority as alleged in the Information.

        "Answer": "NO, the court should not grant the demurrer. While it was alleged in the information that BB was a minor at the time of the commission of the offense, the failure of the prosecutor to present evidence to prove his minority is not a basis for the granting of the demurrer, because minority of the accused is not an element of the crime of rape. Be that as it may, the Court should not consider minority in rendering the decision. After all, the failure of the prosecutor to prove the minority of AA may only affect the imposable penalty but may not absolve him from criminal liability."

        "Question": "Plaintiff sued defendant for collection of P 1 million based on the latter's promissory note. The complaint alleges, among others: 1. Defendant borrowed III 1 million from plaintiff as evidenced by a duly executed promissory note; 2. The promissory note reads: \"Makati, Philippines Dec. 30, 2014 For value received from plaintiff, defendant promises to pay plaintiff III million, twelve (12) months from the above indicated date without necessity of demand. Signed Defendant A copy of the promissory note is attached as Annex “A.” Defendant, in his verified answer, alleged among others: 1. Defendant specifically denies the allegation in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the complaint, the truth being defendant did not execute any promissory note in favor of plaintiff, or 2. Defendant has paid the III million claimed in the promissory note (Annex \"A\" of the Complaint) as evidenced by an \"Acknowledgment Receipt\" duly executed by plaintiff on January 30, 2015 in Manila with his spouse signing as witness. A copy of the \"Acknowledgment Receipt\" is attached as Annex \"1\" hereof. Plaintiff filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that defendant's answer failed to tender an issue as the allegations therein on his defenses are sham for being inconsistent; hence, no defense at all. Defendant filed an opposition claiming his answer tendered an issue. Is judgment on the pleadings proper? ",
        "Answer": "NO, the judgment on the pleadings is not proper. Judgment on the pleading is proper only when the answer fails to tender an issue, or otherwise admits the material allegations of the adverse party's pleading (Sec. 1, Rule 34). When it appears, however, that not all the material allegations of the complaint were admitted in the answer, because some of them were either denied or disputed, and the defendant has set up certain special defenses which, if proven, would have the effect of nullifying plaintiff's main cause of action, judgment on the pleadings cannot be rendered (Philippine National bank v. Aznar, G.R. No. 17105, May 30, 2011).

        "Answer": "NO, the court should not grant the motion for summary judgment because the defense of payment is a genuine issue as to material fact that must be resolved by the court upon presentation of evidence. For a summary judgment to be proper, the movant must establish two requisites: (a) there must be no genuine issue as to any material fact, except for the amount of damages; and (b) the party presenting the motion for summary judgment must be entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. A genuine issue is an issue of fact which requires the presentation of evidence as distinguished from an issue which is sham, fictitious, contrived or false claim. Relative thereto, when the facts pleaded by the parties are disputed or contested, proceedings for a summary judgment cannot take place of a trial. The evidence on record must be viewed in light most favourable to the party opposing the motion who must be given the benefit of all favourable inferences as can reasonably be drawn from the evidence (Smart Communications v.

        "Question": "In a civil action involving three separate causes of action, the court rendered summary judgment on the first two causes of action and tried the third. After the period to appeal from the summary judgment expired, the court issued a writ of execution to enforce the same. Is the writ of execution proper?  (A) No, being partial, the summary judgment is interlocutory and any appeal from it still has to reckon with the final judgment. (B) Yes since, assuming the judgment was not appealable, the defendant should have questioned it by special civil action of certiorari. (C) No, since the rules do not allow a partial summary judgment. (D) No, since special reason is required for execution pending rendition of a final decision in the case.",

        "Question": "Distinguish the two (2) modes of appeal from the judgment of the Regional Trial Court to the Court of Appeals. ",
        "Answer": "In cases decided by the Regional Trial Courts in the exercise of their original jurisdiction, appeals to the Court of Appeals shall be ordinary appeal by filing written notice of appeal indicating the parties to the appeal; specifying the judgment/final order or part thereof appealed from; specifying the court to which the appeal is being taken; and stating the material dates showing the timeliness of the appeal. The notice of appeal shall be filed with the RTC which rendered the judgment appealed from and copy thereof shall be served upon the adverse party within 15 days from notice of judgment or final order appealed from. But if the case admits of multiple appeals or is a special proceeding, a record on appeal is required aside from the written notice of appeal to perfect the appeal, in which case the period for appeal and notice upon the adverse party is not only 15 days but 30 days from notice of judgment or final order appealed from. The full amount of the appellate court docket fee and other lawful fees required must also be paid within the period for taking an appeal, to the clerk of the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from (Secs. 4 and 5, Rule 41, Rules of Court). The periods of 15 or 30 days above-stated are non-extendible. In cases decided by the Regional Trial Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, appeal to the Court of Appeals shall be by filing a verified petition for review with the Court of Appeals and furnishing the RTC and the adverse party with copy thereof, within 15 days from notice of judgment or final order appealed from. Within the same period for appeal, the docket fee and other lawful fees required with the deposit for cost should be paid. The 15-day period maybe extended for 15 days and another 15 days for compelling reasons."

        "Question": "Tom Wallis filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) a petition for Declaration of Nullity of his marriage with Debi Wallis on the ground of psychological incapacity of the latter. Before filing the petition, Tom Wallis had told Debi Wallis that he wanted the annulment of their marriage because he was already fed up with her irrational and eccentric behaviour. However, in the petition for declaration of nullity of marriage, the correct residential address of Debi Wallis was deliberately not alleged and instead, the resident address of their married son was stated. Summons was served by served by substituted service at the address stated in the petition. For failure to file an answer, Debi Wallis was declared in default and Tom Wallis presented evidence ex-parte. The RTC rendered judgment declaring the marriage null and void on the ground of psychological incapacity of Debi Wallis. Three (3) years after the RTC judgment was rendered, Debi Wallis got hold of a copy thereof and wanted to have the RTC judgment reversed and set aside. If you are the lawyer of Debi Wallis, what judicial remedy or remedies will you take? Discuss and specify the ground or grounds for said remedy or remedies. ",
        "Answer": "Debi Wallis may file a Petition for Annulment of Judgment under Rule 47 of the Rules of Court, on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction, extrinsic fraud and denial of the right to due process (Leticia Diona v. Romeo Balange, G.R. No. 173589, January 7, 2013). An action for annulment of judgment is a remedy in law independent of the case where the judgment sought to be annulled was rendered. The purpose of such action is to have the final and executory judgment set aside so that there will be a renewal of litigation. It is resorted to in cases where the ordinary remedies of new trial, appeal, petition for relief from judgment, or other appropriate remedies are no longer available through no fault of the appellant and is base on the grounds of extrinsic fraud, and lack of jurisdiction (Aleban v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 156021, September 23, 2005). Relative thereto, the act of Tom Wallis in deliberately keeping Debi Wallis away from the Court, by intentionally alleging a wrong address in the complaint constitutes extrinsic fraud. Moreover, the failure of the Court to acquire jurisdiction over the person of the respondent, being an indispensable party, necessitates the annulment of judgment of the Regional Trial Court. Likewise, there is denial of the right to due process when Debi Wallis was not given an opportunity to be heard in the case. Hence, the judgment rendered by the RTC may be annulled by the Court of Appeals under Rule 47 of the Rules of Court. Moreover, it is evident that the ordinary remedies of new trial, petition for relief or other appropriate remedies are no longer available through no fault of Debi Wallis because she was able to obtain a copy of the Decision only three (3) years after the same was rendered by the Trial Court. At any rate, the Court erred in declaring the defendant in default because there is no default in a Petition for declaration of nullity of marriage (Sec. 3, Rule 9). Thus, a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court could have been an appropriate remedy within the reglementary period allowed by the Rules."
