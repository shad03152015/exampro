        "Answer": "True. Where a foreign law is not pleaded or even if pleaded, is not proved as a fact, the presumption is that foreign law is the same as domestic law."

        "Question": "A dead child can be legitimated. (TRUE or FALSE. Explain your answer in not more than two (2) sentences.)",
        "Answer": "True. The law provides that legitimation of children who died before the celebration of the marriage will benefit their descendants (Article 181, Family Code). It can be gleaned that the law does not require the child to still be alive at the time of the marriage of his/her parents before legitimation may take place."

        "Question": "Dr. Lopez, a 70-year old widower, and his son Roberto both died in a fire that gutted their home. Dr. Lopez left an estate worth P20M and a life insurance policy in the amount of P1M with his three children — one of whom is Roberto — as beneficiaries. Roberto’s wife, Marilyn, is claiming for herself and her children her husband’s share in the estate left by Dr. Lopez, and her husband's share in the proceeds of Dr. Lopez’s life insurance policy. Rule on the validity of Marilyn’s claims with reasons. ",
        "Answer": "As to Dr. Lopez' estate: Marilyn's claim is without merit because Dr. Lopez and Roberto are presumed to have died at the same time (Article 43, Civil Code), and there shall be no transmission of rights from one to the other. Roberto inherited nothing from his father which he could pass to his wife Marilyn; however, Roberto's children may inherit from Dr. Lopez by right of representation and shall receive 1/3 share of his estate. As to the proceeds of the insurance on the life of Dr. Lopez: Marilyn is entitled to a share because the presumptions on survivorship under the Rules of Court apply; Dr. Lopez (70 years old) is presumed to have died ahead of his younger son Roberto. Roberto's right as beneficiary became vested at the time of Dr. Lopez' death, becoming part of Roberto's estate, which passes on to his surviving heirs (Marilyn and his children)."

        "Question": "Michael and Anna, after obtaining a valid marriage license, had their marriage contract forms signed by the Mayor outside of their presence, without a ceremony. They lived together and had three sons. Is the marriage of Michael and Anna valid, voidable, or void? Explain your answer. ",
        "Answer": "The marriage is void. One of the formal requisites under the Family Code is a marriage ceremony, requiring the consent of the parties to be freely given in the presence of the solemnizing officer. In this case, there was no ceremony conducted, making the marriage void for total absence of a formal requisite."

Wilma and Joseph established permanent residence in the Philippines. Is the divorce obtained by Wilma from Harry recognized in the Philippines? Explain your answer. ",
        "Answer": "Yes, the divorce obtained by Wilma from Harry is recognized as valid in the Philippines, provided that the appropriate petition for recognition of the foreign judgment is filed. Wilma was already a naturalized citizen of a foreign country when she obtained the divorce decree in accordance with her national law; thus, the divorce is considered valid in the Philippines because the nationality principle applies only to Filipino citizens."

Wilma and Joseph established permanent residence in the Philippines. If Harry hires you as his lawyer regarding Wilma's divorce, what legal recourse would you advise him to take? Why? ",
        "Answer": "I will advise Harry to file a petition for the recognition of the foreign divorce decree obtained by Wilma. He may file a petition for declaratory relief and move therein that Wilma was no longer a Filipino citizen at the time she secured the divorce and present evidence as the law of the foreign country on divorce and jurisdiction of the court which issued the divorce. I will also advise him to liquidate their properties."

Should the claims of Alberto and Baldomero be sustained? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, the claims should not be sustained. Edilberto cannot impugn the legitimacy of Alberto and Baldomero as he is not the legal husband of Clarita. There being no filiation between Alberto and Baldomero as against Edilberto, they have no right to inherit from the latter (De Jesus v. Estate of Juan Dizon, G.R. No. 142877, 2 October 2001)."

New York laws do not recognize holographic wills. Can the holographic will of Dr. Fuentes be admitted to probate in the Philippines? Why or why not? ",
        "Answer": "Yes, the holographic will of Dr. Fuentes can be admitted to probate in the Philippines. The will of an alien abroad produces effect in the Philippines if it is executed in accordance with the formalities prescribed by the law in which he resides, or observed in his country, or in accordance with Philippine law, or the law of the place where the will was executed (Article 816, Article 17, Civil Code). Since Dr. Fuentes executed the holographic will in the Philippines, Philippine law shall apply, which recognizes its validity."

        "Question": "Dr. Juanito Fuentes executed a holographic will in the Philippines. He later became a naturalized American citizen residing in New York, where he died. New York laws do not recognize holographic wills. Assuming the will of Dr. Fuentes (American citizen who disinherited his illegitimate son, Jay) is probated in the Philippines, can Jay validly insist that he be given his legitime? Why or why not? ",
        "Answer": "No, Jay cannot validly insist on his legitime. The national law of the testator (New York law) determines the rightful heirs, their order of succession, and their shares, as well as capacity to succeed (Article 16, Article 1039, Civil Code). Since Dr. Fuentes was a citizen of New York at the time of his death, and New York law does not recognize compulsory heirs, Jay may not insist on his legitime."

        "Answer": "The wife shall receive one-half of the estate, while the siblings and nephew inherit the other half (Article 995 & 1001, Civil Code). Half-blood brothers receive one-half of what a full-blood brother gets. The division is: Ramon's wife: P5,000,000.00 (one-half); Three full-blood brothers: P1,000,000.00 each; Nephew (by representation of deceased full-blood brother): P1,000,000.00; Two half-brothers: P500,000.00 each."

The tenants refused, insisting they would only vacate when the lease expired. Is Ildefonso bound to respect the lease contracts between Jude and his tenants? Explain your answer. ",
        "Answer": "Yes, Ildefonso is bound to respect the lease contracts. Ildefonso, as the transferor’s assignee, merely steps into the shoes of Jude. His actual knowledge of the lease puts him on notice that the tenants have an existing contractual right, and thus, he cannot be considered an innocent purchaser for value. He is bound to respect the contract."

The original owners discovered this and hired a lawyer. What action or actions should be instituted? ",
        "Answer": "In view of the good faith of the buyer Luis, no action can be taken by the spouses Teodoro and Anita against him. Luis had the right to rely on what is written on the certificate of title, in the absence of any circumstance that would incite suspicion as to the defect in the title of the transferor."

        "Answer": "Yes, my answer will still be the same. The law states that in motor vehicle mishaps, the owner is solidarily liable with his driver if he was inside the vehicle and could have prevented the accident by the use of due diligence in supervising his driver (Article 2184). However, it is incumbent upon the victim to prove that the owner could have prevented the mishap but failed to do so."

        "Answer": "True. By dation in payment, property is alienated to the creditor in satisfaction of a debt in money (Article 1245, Civil Code). The renouncer is alienating his property to his co-owners in satisfaction of his money obligation (Article 488, Civil Code)."

        "Answer": "No, the suit will not prosper. The court should refuse jurisdiction on the ground of *forum non conveniens* because the parties are not citizens or domiciliaries of the Philippines, and the suit is for annulment which is not governed by Philippine law. Alternatively, assuming jurisdiction is taken, the suit will still not prosper because being American nationals, the dissolution of their marriage is governed by their national law, not the law of Kenya, and sterility is not a ground for annulment under Philippine law (the law of the forum, in absence of proof of US law)."

        "Question": "Assume Emmanuel and Margarita are both Filipinos. After their wedding in Kenya, they return to the Philippines. Can their marriage be annulled on the ground of Emmanuel's sterility? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "No, the marriage cannot be annulled because Philippine law does not provide sterility as one of the grounds for annulment of marriage (Article 45, Family Code). While the formal validity is governed by the law of Kenya, the incidents of marriage and its termination or dissolution are governed by Philippine law."

In this situation, the court may grant the petition despite Rafael's demise, otherwise, the proceedings should be dismissed (Section 13, Republic Act 8552)."

Will your answer to the prior question be the same If it was Dolly (the adoptee) who died during the pendency of the adoption proceedings? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "No, the answer will be different. If it is the adoptee who dies during the pendency of the proceedings, the petition should be dismissed. Death of the prospective adoptee terminates the proceedings as adoption is for the best interest of the adoptee, and this purpose would no longer exist if the latter dies."

        "Answer": "No, Rodolfo cannot compel Rona to use his surname. The law provides that the illegitimate child shall use the surname of the mother, but the child *may* use the surname of the father when the latter has recognized him (Republic Act No. 9255). Since the choice belongs to the child, Rodolfo cannot compel Rona to use his surname."

When Rona (illegitimate child) reaches seven (7) years old, she tells Rodolfo (her father) that she prefers to live with him because he is better off financially than Nanette (her mother). If Rodolfo files an action for the custody of Rona, alleging Rona’s choice, will the court grant Rodolfo’s petition? Why or why not? ",
        "Answer": "No, the court should not grant the petition. Article 176 of the Family Code gives sole parental authority of an illegitimate child to the mother. The father’s recognition of his illegitimate child is a ground to order support but not to award him custody (Briones v. Miguel, G.R. No. 156343 October 18, 2004). Absent any compelling reasons proving Nanette is unfit, Rodolfo's petition must be denied."

The bank declared the whole obligation due and deducted P1M from Sarah's P5M deposit via compensation. Is the bank correct? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "No, the bank is not correct. Both obligations are due, demandable, and liquidated only up to the extent of P300,000.00 (covering the unpaid 3rd, 4th, and 5th monthly installments). Since the facts do not state that the contract contains an acceleration clause, the bank should not have considered the full balance due and demandable. At most, the bank can only deduct P300,000.00 from Sarah's deposit by way of compensation."

Marciano ordered demolition, claiming the alluvium belongs to him as the registered riparian owner and that his right is enforceable against the whole world. Is Marciano correct? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Yes, Marciano is correct. The law states that accretion belongs to the owners of the lands adjoining the banks of the rivers (Article 457, Civil Code), and this right is enforceable against the whole world. While the additional area does not automatically become part of his titled property, Ulpiano cannot acquire it by prescription because his possession was not in the concept of an owner but merely as a holder (farmworker). Only possession in the concept of an owner can serve as a title for acquiring dominion (Article 540, Civil Code)."

What rights, if any, does Ulpiano have against Marciano regarding the reclaimed property? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Ulpiano, even as a possessor in bad faith, is entitled to reimbursement for the taxes he has paid based on quasi-contract, as these charges are properly for the owner's account. Ulpiano also has the right to recover the necessary expenses for the preservation of the land (Article 546, Civil Code)."

        "Answer": "Yes, the contract is valid. The prohibition on *pactum commissorium* (Article 2088, Civil Code) prohibits the creditor from *automatically* appropriating the thing pledged. In this situation, there is no automatic appropriation because Rosario still has to execute a document first in favor of Jennifer before appropriation can occur."

Will your answer to the prior question be the same if the contract stipulates that upon failure of Rosario to redeem the ring on due date, Jennifer may immediately sell the ring and appropriate the entire proceeds thereof for herself as full payment of the loan? Reasons. ",
        "Answer": "No, my answer will be different. Automatic appropriation is prohibited by law. If Jennifer is permitted to immediately sell the ring and appropriate the proceeds without the formality of public auction, it is tantamount to automatic appropriation, which is violative of the provision on *pactum commissorium* and is therefore void."

In 2007, Luciano sued to recover the land, alleging the 1972 sale to an alien was void. Decide the case with reasons. ",
        "Answer": "The suit must be dismissed. While the sale of private land to an alien is generally prohibited by the Constitution, the flaw in the original transaction is considered cured when the property is subsequently transferred to a citizen (Julian). The title of the transferee (Julian) is thus rendered valid (United Church Board of World Ministries v. Sebastian)."

It is not enough that the Filipino spouse proves that the alien spouse has obtained a divorce against him, he must also show that the divorce decree capacitates the alien spouse to remarry (Article 26, Family Code).

Who should the lessees sue for damages? 1) A, the owner 2) B, the engineer 3) both A & B ",
        "Answer": "No. 3 - Both A and B. Under the law, the lessee may proceed against A for breach of contract because the latter, as lessor, is obliged to make all necessary repairs on the property leased (Article 1654, Civil Code) and as the proprietor of the building, A shall also be responsible for the damages resulting from its total or paitial collapse if it is due to lack of necessary repairs (Article 2190, Civil Code). The lessees may also proceed against B for tort liability. The law states that engineer or architect who drew up the plans and specifications for a building is liable for damages if within fifteen (15) years from the completion of the structure, the same should collapse by reason of a defect in those plans and specifications or due to the defects in the ground (Article 1723, Article 2192, Civil Code)."

        "Answer": "No. 4 - **None of the above**. In general, the treasure belongs to the owner of the land where it is found. The exception requires that the treasure must be found **by chance** (Article 438, Civil Code). O, as finder, is not entitled to a share because she was aware that the treasure was buried in Lot B.

Option 3 (B can accept the donation anytime convenient to him) is false because the donee must accept the donation **during the lifetime of the donor** (Article 746, Civil Code).

What is the effect of B being a witness to the will? 1) The will is invalidated 2) The will is valid and effective 3) The legacy given to B's child is not valid ",
        "Answer": "No. 3 - **The legacy given to B's child is invalid**. Under the law, the validity of the will is not affected by the legacy given in favor of the son of an attesting witness. However, the said legacy is **void** (Article 823, Civil Code) because an attesting witness or his spouse, parent, or child is disqualified to become a legatee or devisee, owing to the possible undue influence the witness may exercise upon the testator. This rule is excepted if there are more than three witnesses and one of them was instituted as a legatee or devisee."

        "Answer": "Two reasons for assuming jurisdiction over a conflict of laws case are the **Comity theory** and the **Statute theory**. Comity theory relies on the courtesy, respect, or friendship extended by one jurisdiction to enforce the laws of another jurisdiction (legal reciprocity). Statute theory relies on the existence of a **domestic law** which confers upon the local courts the power to assume jurisdiction."

B ceded his right to their house and lot and all his shares in two business firms to G and their two children, aged 18 and 19.

        "Answer": "Yes, G can still ask for support **pendente lite** from B. Support is ordained between the husband and the wife during the **subsistence of their marriage**, and children are likewise entitled to support from both parents. Since the compromise agreement regarding property dissolution occurred while the nullity case was pending, the marriage has not yet been dissolved, and therefore, G is still entitled to support from B."

At the time of the dissolution of the marriage, the couple possessed the following properties: A house and lot acquired by B on August 3, 1988, one third (1/3) of the purchase price (representing down payment) of which he paid; one third (1/3) was paid by G on February 14, 1990 out of a cash gift given to her by her parents on her graduation on April 6, 1989; and the balance was paid out of the spouses' joint income; and an apartment unit donated to B by an uncle on June 19, 1987. Who owns the foregoing properties? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "The house and lot shall be co-owned by B and G. Since the marriage was declared void (under Article 36) and there was no impediment between the parties, their property relation is governed by the special co-ownership rule in **Article 147 of the Family Code**. However, because the house and lot were acquired by B before the marriage and before their cohabitation, it falls under the **ordinary rules on co-ownership**, where the share is based on proven contribution.

Roberto alleged that he was then invited by his friend to join her at the wedding reception and carried the basket full of fruits which she was bringing to the affair. At the reception, the wedding coordinator of the hotel noticed him and asked him, allegedly in a loud voice, to leave as he was not in the guest list. He retorted that he had been invited to the affair by his friend, who however denied doing so. Deeply embarrassed by the incident, Roberto then sued the hotel for damages under Articles 19 and 21 of the Civil Code. Will Roberto's action prosper? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "No, the action will not prosper. The hotel had the right to ensure the wedding reception was exclusively for those who were invited to the affair, thus, the denial of entry cannot be considered as contrary to law or morals. Firstly, the act of denying entry to Roberto was made in the exercise of a right because it had basis to deny entry to the reception to one who is not in the guest list. Secondly, the act of denying entry cannot be considered contrary to morals, good customs or public policy or that the hotel wilfully caused Roberto loss or injury. On the contrary, Roberto was the one who appears to have acted in bad faith since he wilfully entered the reception of the wedding knowing that he is not one of the invited guests. Thus, Roberto’s action must fail."

        "Answer": "Yes, Ricky is entitled to recover the Pl Million. The fetus was born prematurely with an intrauterine life of only six months. In order to be considered born and to have acquired juridical capacity, the law requires that if the fetus had an intrauterine life of less than seven months, it must survive for twenty-four hours from complete separation from the mother's womb before it may be considered born and possessed of civil personality. In this case, Angela died only 20 hours after birth. Hence, she did not acquire juridical capacity and the donation in her favor did not take effect."

        "Answer": "On the assumption that the parties are governed by the regime of conjugal partnership of gains, the answer would depend on whether the cost of the building is more than that of the land. Based on Article 120 of the Family Code if an improvement is introduced on the exclusive property belonging to one of the spouses using conjugal funds, the entire property (building and the land) shall belong to the conjugal property if the cost of the improvement and the resulting increase in the value of the property are more than the value of the property at the time of the improvement subject to the obligation of the conjugal partnership to reimburse the owner spouse the value of his or her exclusive property. If the cost of the improvement with the use of the conjugal fund is less than the value of the exclusive property of the spouse, then the latter owns the entire property but he or she shall be obligated to reimburse the conjugal partnership at the time the liquidation thereof. The facts did not mention the value of the exclusive property of Maria. Hence, the aforestated rule shall apply in the determination of the issue of whether the building is conjugal or paraphernal."

Is Cipriano capacitated to re-marry by virtue of the divorce decree obtained by his Filipino spouse who was later naturalized as an American citizen? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Yes, Cipriano is capacitated to re-marry. Under Article 26 (2) of the Family Code, where a marriage between a Filipino citizen and a foreigner is validly celebrated and a divorce is thereafter validly obtained abroad by the alien spouse capacitating him or her to remarry, the Filipino spouse shall likewise have capacity to remarry under Philippine law. The Supreme Court ruled that the same rule applies even if the Filipino spouse became naturalized as an alien after the celebration of the marriage. The reckoning point for the application of Article 26 is the citizenship of the parties at the time the divorce is obtained. Hence, Cipriano may remarry (Republic v. Orbecido III, G.R.

Eager of having children of their own, the spouses made it appear that they were the children’s parents by naming them Michelle P. Lim and Michael Jude Lim. Subsequently, Monina married Angel Olario after Primo's death. She decided to adopt the children by availing the amnesty given under R.A. 8552 to those individuals who simulated the birth of a child. She filed separate petitions for the adoption of Michelle, then 25 years old and Michael, 18. Both Michelle and Michael gave consent to the adoption. The trial court dismissed the petition and ruled that Monina should have filed the petition jointly with her new husband. Monina, in a Motion for Reconsideration argues that mere consent of her husband would suffice and that joint adoption is not needed, for the adoptees are already emancipated. Is the trial court correct in dismissing the petitions for adoption? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Yes, the trial court is correct in dismissing the petitions for adoption. The Domestic Adoption Act requires both husband and wife to jointly file the petition for adoption unless the circumstances fall under the enumerated exceptions since the adoptees are not the illegitimate children of Monina and neither are they legitimate children of Monina's husband. Thus, the adoption of Michelle and Michael does not appear to be under the exceptions mentioned in the law which would permit only one of the spouses to file the petition. In the present case, Monina already remarried at the time she filed the petition for adoption, thus, her contention that her husband's consent is enough must fail because the law specifically requires both husband and wife to jointly adopt (In Re Petition for Adoption of Michelle P. Lim and Michael P. Lim, G.R. Nos. 168992-93 May 21, 2009)."

After Jambrich and Descallar separated, Jambrich purchased an engine and some accessories for his boat from Borromeo. To pay for his debt, he sold his rights and interests in the Agro-Macro properties to Borromeo. Borromeo discovered that titles to the three (3) lots have been transferred in the name of Descallar. Who is the rightful owner of the properties? Explain. ",

In such case, all the properties in question acquired by Jambrich using his salaries or wages, or the income from his business or profession are equally owned by them even if Descallar’s contributed consisted merely in the care and maintenance of the household. While it is true that save in cases of hereditary succession, aliens are constitutionally prohibited from owning lands, that defect was cured when Jambrich transferred his shares in Agro-Macro Subdivision to Borromeo, a Filipino, thus making the latter and Descallar the owners thereof.

Rosa opposes the probate alleging such lack of proper authentication. She claims that the unaltered form of the will should be given effect. Whose claim should be granted? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Gregorio should be denied probate because the holographic will with unauthenticated alteration cannot be probated.

The rule is that the will is voided only insofar as the addition or alteration is concerned, but not the whole will itself. If the testator did not interpose his/her full signature, the whole will shall be deemed voided because authentication of the changes with the full signature of the testator is necessary to save the will from invalidity. Rosa's claim to give effect to the unaltered will cannot be granted since the alterations were done by the testator herself and were properly authenticated by her full signature.

As a general rule, the right of the purchaser to the possession of the property commences upon the expiration of the redemption period and its consolidation to the name of the purchaser. In the case of extrajudicial foreclosure, the law provides that the purchaser is entitled to possession upon expiration of the redemption period unless a third party is actually holding the property adversely to the judgment debtor. The issuance of the writ of possession is a ministerial function of the court and does not prescribe in five years. The prescription of actions covered under Article 1149 of the Civil Code does not apply in such a case."

        "Answer": "No, I do not agree. The rule that a petition to declare a marriage void can only be filed by the husband on the wife will not apply to cases of bigamous marriage contracted by either of the parties. The legal spouse has standing to question a subsequent bigamous marriage contracted by the other spouse. (Juliano-Llave v. Republic, G.R. No. 169766, 30 March 2011) ALTERNATIVE ANSWER: Yes, I agree. Under the rules promulgated by the Supreme Court a petition for declaration of nullity of a void marriage may be filed solely by the husband or the wife (A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC)."

        "Question": " A contract to sell is the same as a conditional contract of sale. Do you agree? Explain your answer. ",
        "Answer": "No, I do not agree. A contract to sell is a bilateral contract; whereby the prospective seller expressly reserves ownership of the subject property, despite delivery binds himself to sell the property to the prospective buyer upon fulfillment by the latter of the positive suspensive condition which is usually the full payment of the purchase price. In a conditional sale, the seller may likewise reserve title until the fulfillment of the suspensive condition. However, in a conditional sale, the consent to transfer ownership to the vendee is present, although conditioned upon the happening of a contingent event which may or may not occur. If the suspensive condition is fulfilled, and there was prior delivery of the object to the vendee, ownership thereto automatically transfers to the buyer by operation of law without any further act having to be performed by the seller. In contrast, in a contract to sell, upon the fulfillment of the suspensive condition which is the full payment of the purchase price, ownership will not automatically transfer to the buyer, although the property may have been previously delivered to him. The prospective seller still has to convey title to the prospective buyer by entering into a contract of absolute sale (Nabus v. Pacson, G.R. No. 161318 No- vember 25, 2009)."

My ruling is based on the Civil Code provision that one who has lost any movable or has been unlawfully deprived thereof may recover it from the person in possession of the same. Tambunting's claim of good faith is inconsequential. - Article 559 of the Civil Code applies because the owner of the jewelry was unlawfully deprived of her movable property.

If you are the judge, will you grant the petition? Explain.",
        "Answer": "If I were the judge, I will not grant the petition. While the decision of the church tribunal annulling the marriage of the parties may be persuasive, it is not however, binding upon the civil courts. For psychological incapacity to be a ground for nullity, it must be shown that it was rooted in the history of the party alleged to be suffering from it, it must be grave, serious, and incurable such that it renders the person incapacitated to perform the essential marital obligations due to causes psychological in nature. In the case presented, it appears that Ariz fulfilled his marital obligations at the beginning and it was only after feeling envious about the success of Paz that he started exhibiting violent tendencies and refused to comply with marital obligations. Psychological incapacity is not mere refusal but outright incapacity to perform marital obligations which does not appear to be present in the case of Ariz (Marcos v. Marcos, G.R.

One important provision in his will reads as follows: 'Ang lupa at bahay sa Lungsod ng Maynila ay ililipat at ilalagay sa pangalan nina Alex at Rene hindi bilang pamana ko sa kanila kundi upang pa- mahalaan at pangalagaan lamang nila at nang ang sinuman sa aking mga anak, sampu ng aking mga apo at kaapuapuhan ko sa habang panahon, ay may tutuluyan kung magnanais na mag-aral sa Maynila o sa kalapit na mga lungsod.’ Is the provision valid? (4%)",
        "Answer": "I qualify. The provision conveying or transferring the title to the property to Alex and Rene is valid. However, the provision prohibiting partition forever is not valid. A legacy or devise is to be construed as a donation effective mortis causa, and it is intended to transfer ownership to the legatee or devisee. Since the ownership is legally transferred to Alex and Rene, they cannot be prohibited by the testator from alienating or partitioning the same perpetually. The law provides that dispositions of the testator declaring all or part of the estate inalienable for more than twenty years are void (Article 870). Also, every co-heir has the right to demand the division of the estate unless the testator should have expressly forbidden its partition, in which case the period of indivision shall not exceed twenty years. (Article 1083, Civil Code)."

        "Question": "The Roman Catholic Church accepted a donation of a real property located in Lipa City. A deed of donation was executed, signed by the donor, Don Mariano, and the donee, the Church, as represented by Fr. Damian. Before the deed could be notarized, Don Mariano died. Is the donation valid? (4%)",
        "Answer": "No, the donation is not valid because the subject matter of the donation is real property and hence, the formalities mentioned in Article 749 shall govern. The law requires that the donation of an immovable property must be in a public instrument and that the acceptance may be made in the same deed of donation or in a separate instrument but it shall not take effect, unless it is done during the lifetime of the donor. The donation was never reduced into a public document because the donor died before the deed could be notarized. Hence, it remained a private instrument which renders the donation void."

In 1996, they decided to live together again, and in 1998, they got married. The marriage was declared null and void under Article 36 of the Family Code. Dinah filed a motion for partial reconsideration questioning the portion of the decision on the issuance of a decree of nullity of marriage only after the liquidation, partition and distribution of properties under Article 147 of the Code. If you are the judge, how will you decide petitioner's motion for partial reconsideration? Why? (4%)",
        "Answer": "I will grant partial reconsideration. If the marriage is declared void under Article 36, the provisions of the Family Code on liquidation, partition, and distribution of the properties on absolute community or conjugal partnership will not apply. Instead, Article 147 or Article 148 shall govern the liquidation and partition of the properties of the parties depending on the presence or absence of a legal impediment between them.

The spouses would give a downpayment of P500,000.00 upon the signing of the contract, while the balance would be paid for the next three (3) consecutive months in the amount of Pl,000,000.00 per month. The spouses paid the first two (2) instalments but not the last installment. After one (1) year, the spouses offered to pay the unpaid balance which Honorio refused to accept. The spouses filed a complaint for specific performance against Honorio invoking the application of the Maceda Law. If you are the judge, how will you decide the case? (4%)",
        "Answer": "I will rule in favor of Honorio. The invocation of the Maceda Law is misplaced. The law applies only to sale or financing of realty on installment payments including residential units or residential condominium apartments and does not apply to sales of industrial units or industrial lands like in the case presented. Another reason why the Maceda law will not apply is that the sale in the case at bar is not the sale on installment as contemplated by the law. The sale on installment covered by the Maceda Law is one where the price is paid or amortized over a certain period in equal installments. The sale to the Spouses Dakila is not a sale on installment but more of a straight sale where a down payment is to be made and the balance to be paid in a relatively short period of three months."

Isaac filed an action for consignation in court of the balance of the purchase price, but he failed to give prior notice to Dorotea of his intention to consign the payment in court. Is the consignation valid? (4%)",
        "Answer": "No, the consignation is not valid. For consignation of the thing or sum due to be proper, there must be prior notice to the creditor that the debtor is going to consign the payment in court. This notice is intended to give the creditor the opportunity to accept payment and to avoid liability for costs in case it is found that the act of consignation was properly made.

Novation is the substitution of a new obligation for an old one, which must be so declared in unequivocal terms or the old and new obligations must be incompatible on every point. The acceptance by MSI of payments made by Amoroso does not constitute novation by substitution of debtor (expromision or delegacion) because there was no explicit agreement by J.C. to be released from its obligation."

Edith and Philip would like to recover the properties claiming that they should have been reserved by Peachy in their behalf and must now revert back to them. Is the contention of Edith and Philip valid? (4%)",
        "Answer": "No, the contention is not valid. The property adjudicated to Jun from the estate of his parents which he in turn left to Anita and Cesar is not subject to reservation in favor of Edith and Philip. The lineal character of the reservable property is reckoned from the ascendant from whom the propositus received the property by gratuitous title. The ownership should be reckoned only from Jun, as he is the ascendant from where the first transmission occurred or from whom Cesar inherited the properties. Moreover, Article 891 provides that the person obliged to reserve the property should be an ascendant. Peachy is not Cesar's ascendant but a mere collateral relative. On the assumption that the property is reservable, Edith and Philip being first cousins of Cesar, who is the propositus, are disqualified to be reservatarios as they are not third degree relatives of Cesar."

To fund the project, he obtained a loan form the National Bank (NB) secured by a real estate mortgage over the adjoining property which he also owned. During construction, he built three (3) pumps on the mortgaged property to supply water to the condominium. After one (1) year, the project was completed and the condominium was turned over to the buyers. However, Mr. Bong failed to pay his loan obligation to NB. Thus, NB foreclosed the mortgaged property where the pumps were installed. During the sale on public auction of the mortgaged property, Mr. Simon won in the bidding. When Mr. Simon attempted to take possession of the property, the condominium owners, who in the meantime constituted themselves into Flores de Manila Inc. (FMI), claimed that they have earlier filed a case for the declaration of the existence of an easement before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig City and prayed that the easement be annotated in the title of the property foreclosed by NB. FMI further claimed that when Mr. Bong installed the pumps In his adjoining property, a voluntary easement was constituted in favour of FMI. Will the action prosper? (4%)",
        "Answer": "No, the action will not prosper. An easement or servitude is 'a real right constituted on another's property, corporeal and immovable, by virtue of which the owner of the same has to abstain from doing or to allow somebody else to do something on his property for the benefit of another thing or person.' (Valdez v. Tabisura, G.R. No. 175510, July 28, 2008). It is to be noted that at the time the pumps were built, the property on which it was built also belonged to Mr. Bong. It cannot therefore be said that an easement was established when the pumps were installed as both properties were owned by one and the same person. It would be absurd to say that Mr. Bong constituted an easement on his own property. Thus, there is neither a legal easement or voluntary easement constituted in favor of FMI (Privatization and Management Office vs. Legaspi Towers 300, Inc. G.R. No. 147957 July 22, 2009)."

        "Answer": "I will dismiss the case for annulment of the sale and specific performance filed by Maria with respect to the shares pertaining to Esperanza and Caridad.

Fe cannot sell the shares of Esperanza and Caridad without a special power of attorney from them and the sale with respect to the shares of the latter without their written authority is void under Article 1874.

Any sale or encumbrance made by one spouse without the consent of the other shall be void, although it is considered as a continuing offer on the part of the consenting spouse upon authority of the court or written consent of the other spouse (Article 96 FC)."

As the judge, would you approve such a compromise? ",
        "Answer": "No, I will not approve the compromise agreement because filiation is a matter to be decided by law. It is not for the parties to stipulate whether a person is a legitimate or illegitimate child of another (De Jesus v. Estate of Dizon, 366 SCRA 499)."

Joe is neither a compulsory or intestate heir of Bert and their cohabitation will not vest the former with the right to inherit from the latter. The child will likewise not inherit from Bert because of the lack of formal adoption of the child. A mere ward or ampon has no right to inherit from the adopting parents [Manuel v. Ferrer, G.R.

The RTC granted the petition... the OSG filed an appeal, arguing that sexual infidelity was only a ground for legal separation and that the RTC failed to abide by the guidelines laid down in the Molina case. How would you decide the appeal? ",
        "Answer": "I will grant the appeal and deny the petition for nullity of marriage. While the Supreme Court has previously relaxed the requirements for psychological incapacity, it has consistently maintained that sexual infidelity, per se, is not proof of psychological incapacity. In the case of Tan-Andal v. Andal, G.R. No. 196359, May 11, 2021, the Supreme Court clarified that the root cause of the incapacity must be: 1) grave or serious, 2) incurable, and 3) attributable to the respondent's psychological makeup. Furthermore, the report used here was based on the narration of Kardo, his aide, and his housekeeper. Jurisprudence requires that psychological incapacity must be based on an in-depth assessment of the parties by a qualified psychologist or expert. The failure to personally examine the respondent Glenda would render the psychological report insufficient and thus, the petition must be denied (Marcos v. Marcos, G.R. No. 136490 October 19, 2000)."

In fact, the sellers themselves allowed them to occupy the house make the much needed repairs. As builders in good faith, they have the right to seek reimbursement for the value of the improvements in case the owner decides to appropriate them. In addition they have the right to retain possession of the property until they have been reimbursed the amount they spent. They cannot be asked to remove the improvements because that is not one of the options given by law to the landowner in case the builder is in good faith (Article 448, Civil Code)."

        "Question": "Can Maria be made to reconvey the property? What can she put up as a defense? (4%)",
        "Answer": "If the Deed of Donation is considered void by reason that the notary public had an expired notarial commission and the same impaired the legitime of the property, Maria can be made to reconvey the property to the extent necessary to satisfy the legitime of Jose's illegitimate daughter, provided that the woman claiming to be Jose's child can prove her filiation to the deceased. Maria can set up the defense that the action has prescribed. An action for revocation of the donation on the ground that it impaired the legitime of a compulsory heir may only be filed within ten (10) years from the time the cause of action accrues which is at the time of the death of Jose. The facts are not clear as to when Jose died but on the assumption that he died more ten years prior to the filing of the action, the same has clearly prescribed. Under Article 1144 of the Civil Code, actions upon an obligation created by law must be brought within ten years from the time the right of action accrues. Thus, the ten-year prescriptive period applies to the obligation to reduce inofficious donations, required under Article 771 of the Civil Code, to the extent that they impair the legitime of compulsory heirs (Imperial v.

That night, however, a robber broke into her shop and took everything Including Karla's two dresses. X claims she is not liable to deliver Karla’s dresses or to pay for the clothing materials considering she herself was a victim of the robbery which was a fortuitous event and over which she had no control. Do you agree? Why? ",
        "Answer": "I partially agree. X's obligation here is an obligation to do, to make two dresses for Karla, and an accessory obligation to take care of the clothing materials delivered by Karla. X shall not be liable for the destruction or loss of the dresses because the obligation is to deliver a determinate thing. Furthermore, the loss was due to a fortuitous event, robbery, provided X was not in delay. The obligation of X was to deliver the dresses on the specified day, but X failed to do so, hence X was already in default, and would be liable for damages. However, if no demand was made, X will not be deemed in default. The loss of the materials which X must return shall not extinguish the liability of X to pay for its value, because the obligation is extinguished only for the specific thing which is lost, and X must still pay for damages. X shall be liable for the loss of the dresses because she was already in default, having failed to deliver the dresses. She shall also be liable for the value of the clothing materials delivered by Karla if the latter can prove she made a demand for delivery prior to the robbery, or without proof that demand was dispensed with based on their agreement. Hence, at the time of the fortuitous loss, the debtor X was not yet in default. However, X shall still be liable for the value of the clothing materials delivered by Karla."

Can Jackie still recover the property? Explain. (4%)",
        "Answer": "The contract of sale was voidable on the ground that Jackie is incapable of giving consent at the time of the execution of the sale. Minors are incapable of giving consent to a contract (Article 1327, Civil Code) and where one of the parties is incapable of giving consent, the contract is voidable even though there may have been no damage to the contracting parties (Article 1390, Civil Code). Jackie can no longer recover the townhouse unit because if a contract is voidable on the ground of minority, the action to annul it must be filed within four (4) years from attainment of the age of majority.

Can Clta demand that Pedro pay the entire obligation since he, together with the two others, promised to pay the amount in full after one year? Defend your answer. ",
        "Answer": "No, Cita cannot demand that Pedro pay the entire obligation because the obligation in this case is presumed to be joint. The concurrence of two or more creditors or of two or more debtors in one and the same obligation does not imply that each one of the former has a right to demand, or that each one of the latter is bound to render, entire compliance with the prestation. There is is solidary liability only when the obligation expressly so states, or when the law or the nature of the obligation requires solidarity (Article 1207, Civil Code). In a joint obligation, there is no mutual agency among the joint debtors such that if one of them is insolvent the others shall not be liable for his share.

Julia claims she has no obligation to return the interest paid by Sara because it was a natural obligation which Sara voluntarily performed and can no longer recover. Do you agree? Explain. (4%)",
        "Answer": "No, I do not agree. No interest shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated in writing (Article 1956, Civil Code). In the absence of a written stipulation for the payment of interest, the payment made by Sara is one that is not due. Hence, she is entitled to recover the interest paid under the principle of solutio indebiti which arises when something is received when there is no right to demand it, and it was unduly delivered through mistake (Article 2154, Civil Code).

The placing of the title in the name of X for the purpose of holding it for the benefit of his siblings constitutes an implied trust (Article 1448, Civil Code) where X is the trustee and his siblings are the beneficiaries. An action for reconveyance based on an implied trust arising from fraud prescribes in ten years.

Conversely, an attack is indirect or collateral when, in an action to obtain a different relief, an attack on the proceeding is nevertheless made as an incident thereof. Such action to attack a certificate of title may be an original action or a counterclaim, in which a certificate of title is assailed as void (Firaza Sr. v. Ugay, G.R.

The facts state that Juliet acquired American citizenship, hence, she may obtain a divorce abroad which if valid in accordance with her national law shall also be regarded as valid in the Philippines provided that the divorce is proven as a fact in accordance with the rules on evidence in an appropriate proceeding filed before our courts (Republic v. Orbecido, G.R. No. 154380 October 5, 2005)."

        "Question": "Leo married Lina and they begot a son. After the birth of their child, Lina exhibited unusual behaviour and started to neglect her son; she frequently went out with her friends and gambled in casinos. Lina later had extra-marital affairs with several men and eventually abandoned Leo and their son. Leo was able to talk to the psychiatrist of Lina who told him that Lina suffers from dementia praecox, a form of psychosis where the afflicted person Is prone to commit homicidal attacks. Leo was once stabbed by Lina but fortunately he only suffered minor injuries. Will a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage filed with the court prosper? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "The petition for nullity of marriage will prosper. The facts presented show that Lina is afflicted with dementia praecox, a form of psychosis, which makes her unable to comply with the essential marital obligations, constituting psychological incapacity. Based on jurisprudence, the gravity of the psychological incapacity is determined by whether the incapacity is grave or serious, incurable, and rooted in the history of the party afflicted. The symptoms exhibited by Lina—neglect of her son, gambling, extra-marital affairs, abandonment, and psychosis leading to violence—point to a psychological condition rendering her unable to perform the duties of marriage. However, a conclusive diagnosis of a grave, severe and incurable presence of psychological incapacity must still be based on an in-depth assessment of the parties by a psychologist or expert (Ngo Te v. Yu-Te, G.R. No. 161793, 13 February 2009, 579 SCRA 193; Paz v. Paz G.R. No. 166579 February 18, 2010)."

        "Answer": "Yes, Dorothy's suit will prosper. Under Article 147, if the parties who are capacitated to marry each other live exclusively with each other as husband and wife without the benefit of marriage or under a void marriage, their wages and salaries shall be owned by them in equal shares and the property acquired by both of them through their work or industry shall be governed by the rules on co-ownership. Dorothy and Bernard's union is covered by Article 147, and neither party can encumber or dispose by acts inter vivos of his or her share in the property acquired during cohabitation and owned in common without the consent of the other, until after the termination of the cohabitation."

        "Answer": "If the property was acquired by Dorothy and Bernard during their cohabitation, which ended when they physically separated, the property, if found to be co-owned, must be partitioned equally between them. The law states that upon termination of the cohabitation, the corresponding share of the party who did not act in bad faith will comprise his or her share in the co-ownership. Bernard, having disposed of the common property without consent, acted in bad faith, hence Dorothy is entitled to her share in the co-ownership as well as the portion pertaining to Bernard."

Daniel took possession of the accretion since 1923, as shown by a tax declaration. In 1958, Benjamin filed a Complaint for Quieting of Title, claiming the alluvium belonged to him as riparian owner and was part of his registered property. Daniel claimed ownership by prescription. Decide the case and explain. ",
        "Answer": "The alluvium belongs to Benjamin as the riparian owner (Article 457, Civil Code). However, Benjamin's assertion that the accretion automatically becomes part of his registered property is not correct; while it is automatically owned by the riparian owner, it needs a separate act of registration for it to be covered by the Torrens title. Nonetheless, Daniel's claim of acquisitive prescription should prevail. Although Daniel's possession prior to the land being declared alienable is insufficient, the facts indicate that Daniel took possession in 1923 and Benjamin filed suit in 1958, meaning Daniel had been in possession for more than 30 years, thus acquiring the land by extraordinary acquisitive prescription."

The spouses fled and resided in Manila for 35 years. Upon returning, they filed a suit for reconveyance against Romeo's grandson (the current title holder), who raised the defenses of laches and prescription. Decide the case and rule on the defenses. ",
        "Answer": "The case filed by Joven and Juliana for reconveyance will prosper. The Deed of Sale, having been signed by Joven and Juliana by force and intimidation, is void and not merely voidable because the sale has no cause or consideration (Article 1352 and Article 1409). Hence, the title subsequently issued to Romeo's grandson is likewise void it being derived from the void title of Romeo. The claim that the right to recover possession is barred by laches and prescription is untenable because the action to declare a void deed of sale void is imprescriptible. Neither will laches apply because the delay in asserting their right could not be considered unreasonable in view of the threat to their life."

        "Answer": "No, the obligation of Butch was not extinguished by dacion en pago upon the mere surrender of the SUVs. Dacion en pago (dation in payment) requires the conveyance of ownership of a property as an accepted equivalent of the performance of the obligation. The arrangement here was merely for Hagibis to sell the vehicles and credit the proceeds to the loan, which does not constitute transfer of ownership as full satisfaction of the debt; rather, it implies a contract of agency or security."

        "Answer": "Jerico's claim that there is no novation is correct, and Jojo is not relieved of his undertaking. Novation is never presumed, and requires an express agreement or that the old and new obligations are incompatible on every point. A surety is released from obligation if there is a material alteration of the principal contract. However, the MOA here only involved a revision of the work schedule, and expressly maintained all other terms and conditions of the original contract. Since the original obligation remains fundamentally the same, there was no novation, and Jojo remains liable under the Surety undertaking (Security Bank and Trust Company, Inc, v.

Ellen sued to nullify the mortgage, auction sale, and title of Mega Bank, claiming the bank was not a mortgagee in good faith. Decide the case with reasons. ",
        "Answer": "The case filed by Ellen should prosper, and the mortgage and subsequent foreclosure are void. While persons dealing with registered land generally only need to look at the title, banks and financial institutions are held to a **higher standard of diligence**. Mega Bank failed to exercise the required due diligence when it granted the loan, as the bank relied on Julia who represented herself as Ellen, using a forged Special Power of Attorney. Since Mega Bank is deemed a mortgagee in bad faith, the principle that a forged instrument may be the root of a valid title does not apply, because the bank did not exercise extraordinary diligence."

Noel argued it was a valid sale with pacto de retro and Ariel failed to redeem. As the RTC judge, decide the case with reasons. ",
        "Answer": "I will rule in favor of Ariel and declare that the contract between them is an **equitable mortgage**. An equitable mortgage is one which, although lacking in some formality, nevertheless reveals the intention of the parties to charge real property as security for a debt. The retention of actual possession of the lot by Ariel (the vendor) and his continued payment of real property taxes are clear statutory presumptions that the contract was intended to secure a debt, rather than effect a true transfer of ownership (Article 1602, Civil Code, as implied by the answer)."

In breach of contract cases, moral damages may only be awarded if the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith (Art. 2220, Civil Code). Since the context only implies breach of contract, and there is no explicit mention of fraud or bad faith on the part of RPP, the award of moral damages is improper.

Should Arthur’s possession be reckoned from the date when the lot was declared A and D or from the date of actual possession? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "The possession of Arthur should be reckoned only from the date the lot was declared **alienable and disposable (A and D)** by the State, and not from the date of actual possession. Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act, in relation to Section 14(1) of the Property Registration Decree, presupposes that the land subject of the application must have already been classified as agricultural land of the public domain. Possession of the land while it is still classified as inalienable, no matter how long, will not ripen into ownership. Since the land was declared alienable only in 1993 and the application was filed in 1998, Arthur's possession is short of the thirty year period required for acquisitive prescription, hence the application should be denied."

Is the exercise by Peter of his power to rescind extra-judicially the proper and legal way rescinding said contract? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "As a general rule, the power to rescind an obligation must be invoked judicially and cannot be exercised solely on a party's own judgment. However, the contract here is a **Contract to Sell**, not a Contract of Sale, where Peter reserves ownership and his obligation to convey title only arises upon full payment. In a contract to sell, failure to pay the full price is not considered a breach but merely the **non-happening of a suspensive condition**, which prevents the seller’s obligation to convey title from arising.

Tomas, Jr. argued that Article 992 is unconstitutional because it prevents him from inheriting while allowing an illegitimate child of an illegitimate parent to represent. Decide the case and explain. ",
        "Answer": "I will rule in favor of Tristan. Article 992 establishes a barrier (the iron curtain rule) preventing an illegitimate child (Tomas, Jr.) from inheriting *ab intestato* from the legitimate relatives of his father (Don Ricardo). The descendants of a legitimate child, in order to represent the latter, must themselves be legitimate. Tomas, Jr., being an illegitimate child of the legitimate son (Tomas) of Don Ricardo, is excluded from inheriting from Don Ricardo.

Macario claimed his adverse claim provided notice to the world. Who has the superior right over the disputed property, Macario or Alex? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Macario has a better right to the land. Actual notice of an adverse claim is equivalent to registration, and the subsequent registration of the Notice of Levy could not have any legal effect due to the prior inscription of the adverse claim annotated on the title (Guidote v.

The doctrine of **corporate negligence** allows allocating liability for negligent acts of health practitioners.

Interest on the unpaid compensation becomes due as compliance with the constitutional mandate on eminent domain and as a basic measure of fairness. Thus, interest runs as a matter of law and follows as a matter of course from the right of the landowner to be placed in as good a position as money can accomplish, as of the date of taking (Evergreen Manufacturing Corporation vs. Republic of the Philippines (G.R. No. 218628, September 6, 2017)."

        "Question": "Distinguish antichresis from usufruct. ",
        "Answer": "Antichresis is a **contract** which gives the creditor the right to receive the fruits of an immovable of his debtor, with the obligation to apply them to the payment of the interest, if owing, and thereafter to the principal of his credit (Article 2132, Civil Code). While usufruct is the **right** to enjoy the property of another with the obligation of preserving its form and substance, unless the title constituting it or the law otherwise provides (Article 562, Civil Code). Antichresis is an **accessory contract**, while usufruct is a **principal contract**. In antichresis, the creditor does not have the obligation to file a bond upon entering into possession, unlike in usufruct where the general rule is that the usufructuary must file a bond (Article 583, Civil Code). Furthermore, in antichresis, the creditor does not have the right to introduce improvements, whereas a usufructuary may make useful improvements or expenses for mere pleasure, provided he does not alter its form and substance (Article 579, Civil Code)."

        "Question": "Jacob had been leasing a piece of land... he purchased the land from the owner, and since then he had been in open, continuous, and exclusive possession of the property. In 2017, when he attempted to register the property, Jacob learned that the Republic had filed an application for the registration of the property in 1982. What remedies are available to Jacob to recover possession of his property under the circumstance? Explain your answer. (4%)",
        "Answer": "There are three (3) remedies available to one who has been dispossessed of property: (I) an action for ejectment to recover possession, whether for unlawful detainer or forcible entry; (2) **accion publiciana** or accion plenaria de posesion, or a plenary action to recover the right of possession; and (3) **accion reivindicatoria**, or an action to recover ownership (Republic v. Guerrero, 520 Phil. 296, 307 (2006)). Since Jacob had been in possession since 1990 (when he purchased the land) until 2017 when he attempted registration, he can no longer avail of the summary remedy of forcible entry (which must be filed within one year from dispossession). However, he could still recover possession by an *accion publiciana*. In *accion publiciana*, the objective is to recover possession only, not ownership."

The current route to the public highway is a kilometer's walk through the northern lot of Riley, but the route is a rough road that gets muddy during the rainy season, and is inconvenient because it is only 2.5 meters wide. Tyler's nearest access to the public highway would be through the southern lot of Dylan. Can Tyler legally demand that an easement of right of way be established on Dylan's lot? Explain your answer. (4%)",
        "Answer": "Tyler cannot legally demand that an easement of right of way be established on Dylan's lot. For the establishment of a compulsory easement, three things must concur: (a) The property is isolated and has no adequate outlet to a public highway; (b) The easement must be established at a point least prejudicial to the servient estate where the distance from the dominant estate to the public highway may be the shortest; and (c) There must be payment of proper indemnity. The facts state that Tyler has a right of way through Riley's property. The circumstance that it may be inconvenient because it is a rough road and it becomes muddy does not justify the establishment of the easement on another's property. The **true test is adequacy of the outlet** to the public highway and not the convenience of the dominant estate."

        "Answer": "The sale made by Danny is **void**. The parties married after the effectivity of the Family Code, where the default property regime is absolute community of property (ACP). Under ACP, all properties which each spouse owns at the time of marriage, as well as whatever they may acquire thereafter, form part of the absolute community. The sale or encumbrance of ACP property without the consent of the other spouse or authority of the court is void (Article 96, Family Code). (Alternative Answer: On the assumption that the parties are governed by the regime of conjugal partnership of gains, the sale would be considered **valid**. If the land was purchased by Danny before his marriage, it is deemed his exclusive property and he may therefore sell or alienate it without the consent of Elsa (Article 111, Family Code)."

        "Answer": "I will advise Nolan that he may file an action to **ask the court to fix the period for compliance** by Zeny of her obligation to him.

The document is in reality a **suretyship agreement** because Rosella bound herself solidarily for the obligation contracted by Kevin (Article 2047, Civil Code). In suretyship, the liability of the surety is similar to that of a solidary debtor, meaning the creditor may proceed against any one of the solidary debtors or some or all of them simultaneously (Article 1216, par. 1 Civil Code).

Prior to the marriage, they agreed in a marriage settlement that the regime of conjugal partnership of gains shall govern their property relations during marriage. Shortly after the marriage, their daughter, Shalimar, was born. Before they met and got married, Sancho purchased a parcel of land on installment, under a Contract of Sale, with the full purchase price payable in equal annual amortizations over a period of ten (10) years, with no down payment, and secured by a mortgage on the land. The full purchase price was PhP1 million, with interest at the rate of 6% per annum. After paying the fourth (4th) annual installment, Sancho and Sandy got married, and Sancho completed the payments in the subsequent years from his salary as an accountant. The previous payments were also paid out of his salary. During their marriage, Sandy also won PhP1 million in the lottery and used it to purchase jewelry. When things didn't work out for the couple, they filed an action for declaration of nullity of their marriage based on the psychological incapacity of both of them.

(d) Is Shalimar entitled to payment of presumptive legitime? If yes, how much should be her share and from where should this be taken? ",
        "Answer": "(a) Shalimar is a legitimate child of Sancho and Sandy, as children conceived or born during the marriage of the parents are legitimate. (b) The property relationship to be liquidated will be that of a co-ownership. Since the parties had no impediment to marry each other and the marriage was declared void by reason of psychological incapacity, the rules on equal co-ownership under Article 147 of the Family Code shall apply to the liquidation of properties acquired during their cohabitation. (c) The parcel of land shall belong exclusively to Sancho, subject to reimbursement to the co-ownership for the payments made during the marriage. This is because Article 147 (co-ownership) only covers property acquired by the parties through their work or industry during their cohabitation, and since Sancho started purchasing the land before they met and got married, ownership retroacts to the time of acquisition. The jewelry won by Sandy in the lottery shall belong exclusively to Sandy, as winnings from gambling or betting are excluded from the operation of Article 147 and belong exclusively to the winner. (d) No, Shalimar is not entitled to the delivery of her presumptive legitime. Article 50 of the Family Code, which mandates the delivery of presumptive legitimes, does not apply to marriages which are declared void ab initio under Article 36 (psychological incapacity)."

While growing up, she developed male characteristics and was diagnosed to have congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) which is a condition where a person possesses both male and female characteristics. At puberty, tests revealed that her ovarian structures had greatly minimized, and she had no breast or menstrual development. Alleging that for all intents and appearances, as well as mind and emotion, she had become a male, she prayed that her birth certificate be corrected such that her gender should be changed from female to male, and that her first name should be changed from Sharon to Shariff. Silverio (male at birth, underwent sex reassignment, name changed to Shelley) and Sharon (Shariff) fell in love and decided to marry. They traveled to Las Vegas, USA where they got married based on the law of the place of celebration of the marriage. They, however, kept their Philippine citizenship. (a) Is there any legal basis for the court to approve Silverio's petition for correction of entries in his birth certificate?  (b) Will your answer be the same in the case of Sharon's petition?  (c) Can the marriage of Silverio (Shelley) and Sharon (Shariff) be legally recognized as valid in the Philippines? ",
        "Answer": "(a) No, there would be no legal basis for the court to approve Silverio's petition. To be entitled to a change of name, the petitioner must show proper and reasonable cause, and a change of name based on sex reassignment is not permitted under the rules. Furthermore, Silverio was born anatomically male, so there is nothing to correct in the birth certificate. (b) My answer will not be the same with respect to Sharon's petition. The court may allow the change of gender and name for Sharon because she is a biologically or naturally intersex individual suffering from a congenital defect (CAH). The determining factor in her gender classification would be what the individual, having reached the age of majority, with good reason thinks of his/her sex, and the change of name corresponds to her preferred gender. (c) No, the marriage of Shelley and Shariff cannot be considered as valid in the Philippines. Although marriages solemnized outside of the Philippines, if valid where celebrated, are generally valid here (lex loci celebrationis rule), an exception exists if the marriage is contracted between parties without legal capacity. Since both are Filipino citizens, their legal capacity and status are governed by Philippine laws pursuant to the nationality principle (Article 15, Civil Code), which voids same-sex marriage."

Each co-owner has full ownership of their part and may alienate, assign, or mortgage it (Article 493, Civil Code).

Santi is deemed a landowner in bad faith since he knew of the encroachment but did not object.

By her own choice, she remained unmarried and devoted all her time to taking care of her nephew and two (2) nieces: Socrates, Saffinia, and Sophia. She wrote a will giving all her properties remaining upon her death to the three (3) of them. The will was admitted to probate during her lifetime. Later, she decided to make a new will giving all her remaining properties only to the two (2) girls, Saffinia and Sophia. She then tore up the previously probated will. The second will was presented for probate only after her death. However, the probate court found the second will to be void for failure to comply with formal requirements. (a) Will the doctrine of dependent relative revocation apply?  (b) Will your answer be the same if the second will was found to be valid but both Saffinia and Sophia renounce their inheritance? ",
        "Answer": "(a) Yes, the doctrine of dependent relative revocation will apply. This doctrine states that where the act of destruction (tearing up the first will) is connected with the making of another will, and it raises the inference that the testator meant the revocation of the old to depend upon the efficacy of a new disposition, the revocation is conditional. If the new will (the second will) is found to be inoperative (void due to formal defects), the attempted revocation fails, and the original will remains in full force. (b) Yes, the answer will still be the same, meaning the first will is not revived. The renunciation by Saffinia and Sophia (named heirs in the second will) does not change the fact that Sydney already performed the overt act of tearing the original will to revoke it. The circumstance that the heirs named in the subsequent will renounced their inheritance will not alter the fact that the original will was revoked and can no longer be given effect."

        "Question": "Simon, a married man, underwent sex reassignment in a foreign country, changed his name to Simone, and filed a petition for correction of entry in his birth certificate to change his sex from male to female and his name to Simone. Simone later filed a petition for legal separation against his wife on the ground of sexual infidelity. His wife opposed, arguing that Simone cannot file for legal separation as he is still a male, and only a female spouse can commit sexual infidelity. (a) Can Simone legally file for legal separation?  (b) Can Simone validly obtain the correction of entries in his birth certificate to change his sex from male to female and his name to Simone? ",
        "Answer": "(a) Yes, Simone can legally file for legal separation. The law does not state that the spouse filing for legal separation must be female; it states that the offended spouse may file the petition. The Family Code defines sexual infidelity as a ground for legal separation without gender distinction as to who the offended spouse is. (b) No, Simone cannot validly obtain the correction of entries in his birth certificate to change his sex to female. Philippine law does not allow change of sex based on sex reassignment surgery, as this would conflict with laws on marriage and family rights."

        "Question": "Newlyweds Sam and Sienna had contracted with Sangria Hotel for their wedding reception. The couple was so unhappy with the service, claiming, among other things, that there was an unreasonable delay in the service of dinner and that certain items promised were unavailable. The hotel claims that, while there was a delay in the service of the meals, the same was occasioned by the sudden increase of guests to 450 from the guaranteed expected number of 350, as stated in the Banquet and Meeting Services Contract. In the action for damages for breach of contract instituted by the couple, they claimed that the Banquet and Meeting Services Contract was a contract of adhesion since they only provided the number of guests and chose the menu. On the other hand, the hotel's defense was that the proximate cause of the complainant's injury was the unexpected increase in their guests, and this was what set the chain of events that resulted in the alleged inconveniences. (a) Does the doctrine of proximate cause apply in this case?  (b) Was the Banquet and Meeting Services Contract a contract of adhesion? If yes, is the contract void? ",
        "Answer": "(a) No, the doctrine of proximate cause will not apply to this case. This doctrine is applicable only in actions for quasi-delicts (tort liability), not in actions involving a breach of contract, where a pre-existing contractual relationship exists. In breach of contract cases, Article 1170 of the Civil Code applies, concerning liability for fraud, negligence, delay, or contravention of the tenor of the obligation. (b) Yes, the contract was a contract of adhesion, as the terms and conditions were prepared solely by the hotel, and the couple merely adhered to them. However, a contract of adhesion is not void *per se*; it is only construed strictly against the party who prepared it in case of ambiguity."

Sergio later tendered the remaining balance of P1,450,000.00 to Samantha (P1.5M less P50k paid). Samantha refused the tender on the ground that she was the one supposed to pay the bills and Sergio did not have authorization to pay on her behalf. Sergio filed a consignation (P1.45M) and sought specific performance. (a) What is the effect of payment made by Sergio without the knowledge and consent of Samantha?  (b) Is Samantha guilty of mora accipiendi? ",
        "Answer": "(a) The payment made by Sergio without the knowledge and consent of Samantha extinguished Samantha's obligation to the utility company. Sergio is entitled to recover what he paid from Samantha to the extent that the latter may have been benefited by his payment (Article 1236, Civil Code). Alternatively, Sergio is deemed a person interested in the fulfillment of the obligation since he cannot continue operating the business without paying the utility company, leading to legal subrogation, making Sergio the new creditor of Samantha for P50,000.00 (Article 1302(3), Civil Code). (b) Yes, Samantha is guilty of *mora accipiendi* (delay on the part of the creditor). Her refusal to accept the tender of payment of the balance (P1,450,000.00) without just cause placed her in delay, especially since Sergio's payment of the utility bills was proper and beneficial to her."

Part of the bank opening forms was a Holdout Agreement which provided that, should he incur any liability or obligation to the bank, the bank shall have the right to immediately and automatically take over his savings account deposit. After he opened his deposit account, the Shanghainese Bank discovered a scam wherein the funds in the account of another depositor in the bank was withdrawn by an impostor. Shanghainese Bank suspected Saachi to be the impostor, and filed a criminal case of estafa against him. While the case was still pending with the Prosecutor's office, the bank took over Saachi's savings deposit on the basis of the Holdout Agreement. (a) What is the nature of the contract between Saachi and the Shanghainese Bank?  (b) Can the Shanghainese Bank legally take over Saachi's savings deposit? ",
        "Answer": "(a) The contract between Saachi and Shanghainese Bank is a simple loan or *mutuum*, not a contract of deposit. In a simple loan, the bank acquires ownership of the money and may use it, with the obligation to return the same amount. (b) No, the bank had no right to take over Saachi's bank deposit. The Holdout Agreement could only be invoked if the depositor has incurred any liability or obligation to the bank. Since the criminal case filed by the bank was still pending, no liability was yet established, and the bank failed to show that Saachi had an existing obligation derived from law, contracts, quasi-contracts, delicts, or quasi-delicts (Article 1157, Civil Code)."

A chattel mortgage was constituted on the same machineries as security for the amount. As additional security, the President of SI, Stan Smith, mortgaged his house and lot. SI failed to pay the 16th and succeeding monthly installments. SEP then commenced a collection suit against SI, and in the course of the proceedings, a writ of attachment was issued against SI’s properties, including the mortgaged machineries. The attached properties were subsequently sold at public auction, but the proceeds thereof were insufficient to satisfy the judgment credit. (a) Can SEP legally recover the deficiency?  (b) Instead of collecting the deficiency, can SEP commence extrajudicial proceedings to foreclose the mortgage on Stan’s house and lot in order to recover the deficiency? ",
        "Answer": "(a) Yes, SEP can recover the deficiency from SI. The Chattel Mortgage Law (Recto Law) prohibits the recovery of deficiency only when the creditor chooses the remedy of foreclosing the chattel mortgage. Since SEP chose to file a collection suit and pursued attachment and execution, recovery of the deficiency is allowed under ordinary contract rules. (b) Yes, SEP can commence extrajudicial proceedings to foreclose the mortgage on Stan Smith's house and lot. The mortgage provided by Stan Smith is an additional security independent of the Recto Law limitation, and the real estate mortgage provided by a third party (Stan Smith) may be enforced to satisfy the deficiency."

Since Socorro was allegedly removing portions of the land and cement that supported the adjoining property, Segunda caused the annotation of an adverse claim against 50 sq. m. on Lot A's Transfer Certificate of Title, asserting the existence of a legal easement. (a) Does a legal easement in fact exist? If so, what kind?  (b) If a legal easement does in fact exist, Is an annotation of an adverse claim on the title of the servient estate proper? ",
        "Answer": "(a) Yes, a legal easement does in fact exist. The legal easement is that of **subjacent and lateral support** (Article 684, Civil Code), which dictates that no proprietor shall make such excavations upon his land as to deprive any adjacent land or building of sufficient lateral or subjacent support. (b) No, the annotation of an adverse claim on the title of the servient estate is not proper and would be unnecessary. Legal easements are constituted by law itself, and the property is deemed encumbered by law even without registration. An adverse claim is generally required to apprise third persons of a controversy over ownership or interest, and is usually appropriate only for claims adverse to the registered owner arising subsequent to the original registration."

        "Answer": "(a) Yes, Simon may compel Shannon to reduce the agreement into writing. Although the contract is obligatory in whatever form (Article 1356, Civil Code), a lease agreement for more than one year is covered by the Statute of Frauds (Article 1403, Civil Code).

Semuel thereafter came home and filed a petition with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) for partition of the common properties acquired during his union with Sofia in the Philippines. The properties acquired during the union consisted of a house and lot in Cavite worth PhP2 million, and some personal properties, including cash in bank amounting to PhP1 million. All these properties were acquired using Semuel's salaries and wages since Sofia was a stay-at-home mother. In retaliation, Sofia filed an action, on behalf of their minor children, for support. (a) How should the properties be partitioned?  (b) Should Semuel be required to support the minor children? ",
        "Answer": "(a) The properties must be partitioned equally between Sofia and Semuel (PhP1.5 million each) in accordance with the rules on co-ownership under Article 147 of the Family Code. Since they were capacitated to marry each other, their wages and salaries, and properties acquired through their work or industry, are owned by them in equal shares. The law presumes that properties acquired while they lived together were obtained by their joint efforts, and Sofia’s contribution as a stay-at-home mother is considered sufficient contribution for her equal share. (b) Yes, Semuel should be required to support the minor children. The natural duty of parents to support their illegitimate children is mandatory under Philippine law (Article 195, Family Code). Furthermore, Semuel's denial of financial support, if committed while he is in the Philippines, is considered a criminal offense under Philippine law (VAWC Act), applying the territoriality principle in criminal law, notwithstanding his German citizenship."

SMA claims that SAL should be the one liable as it was the one who issued the ticket. (a) Should either, or both, SAL and SMA be held liable for the damages that Shasha suffered?  (b) Assuming that one is an agent of the other, is the agency coupled with interest? ",
        "Answer": "(a) Both SAL and SMA should be held liable for damages to Shasha. SAL is liable for breach of the contract of carriage because issuing a ticket covering the entire leg guaranteed that successive air carriers, like SMA, would honor the ticket. SMA is also liable as a successive carrier. The contract of a common carrier generates a public duty, and bumping off a passenger with a confirmed reservation entitles her to moral and exemplary damages. (b) Yes, the arrangement may be considered an **agency coupled with an interest**. This type of agency is established for the mutual benefit of the principal and agent, or is the means of fulfilling an obligation already contracted. In this case, the agency was created as a means of fulfilling an obligation already contracted (the carriage of Shasha), making it one established for the mutual benefit of the parties (Sevilla vs. Court of Appeals)."

He entered into an agreement with Solid Surety Company (SSC) for SSC to issue a bond in favor of the BIR to secure payment of his taxes, if found to be due. In consideration of the issuance of the bond, he executed an Indemnity Agreement with SSC whereby he agreed to indemnify the latter In the event that he was found liable to pay the tax. The BIR eventually decided against Sebastian, and judicially commenced action against both Sebastian and SSC to recover Sebastian's unpaid taxes. Simultaneously, BIR also initiated action to foreclose on the bond. Even before paying the BIR, SSC sought indemnity from Sebastian on the basis of the Indemnity Agreement. Sebastian refused to pay since SSC had not paid the BIR anything yet, and alleged that the provision in the Indemnity Agreement which allowed SSC to recover from him, by mere demand, even if it (SSC) had not yet paid the creditor, was void for being contrary to law and public policy. Can Sebastian legally refuse to pay SSC? ",
        "Answer": "No, Sebastian cannot legally refuse to pay SSC. The agreement is one of **indemnity against liability**, not merely indemnity against loss. Indemnity against loss only renders the indemnitor liable after payment is made or loss is sustained. Conversely, indemnity against liability becomes operative as soon as the liability of the person indemnified (SSC) arises, regardless of actual payment. Since Sebastian's liability arose when the BIR decided against him, SSC is entitled to recover from Sebastian based on the terms of the valid Indemnity Agreement."

In the middle of the journey, the bus collided with a truck coming from the opposite direction, which was overtaking the vehicle in front of the truck. Though the driver of the SBL bus tried to avoid the truck, a mishap occurred as the truck hit the left side of the bus. As a result of the accident, Simeon suffered a fractured leg and was unable to report for work for one week. He sued SBL for actual and moral damages. SBL raised the defense that it was the driver of the truck who was at fault, and that it exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of its driver. (a) Is SBL liable for actual damages? Moral damages?  (b) Will SBL be liable to pay interest if it is required to pay damages, and delays in the payment of the judgment award? What is the rate of interest, and from when should the interest start running? ",
        "Answer": "(a) Yes, SBL is liable for actual damages, assuming Simeon substantiated his claim. As a common carrier, SBL is obligated to exercise extraordinary diligence, not merely the diligence of a good father of a family, and cannot invoke the negligence of a third party (the truck driver) to escape liability to its passengers. However, SBL is generally **not** liable for moral damages. Moral damages in breach of contract cases are recoverable only if the mishap results in the death of a passenger, or if the carrier is guilty of fraud or bad faith. Since Simeon merely sustained injuries, he cannot recover moral damages. (b) Yes, SBL may be held liable for interests if it delays the payment of the monetary awards. The rate of interest is **6% per annum**, reckoned from the finality of the judgment until its satisfaction. This interim period is deemed equivalent to a forbearance of credit."

The **bad faith of the landowner and the builder shall compensate each other**, rendering both parties to be in good faith. Thus, the situation would still be governed by Article 448 of the Civil Code, where the landowner (Mr. P) retains the right to exercise the options (to appropriate or to compel the builder to buy the land) and the builder (Mr. A) cannot compel Mr. P to purchase the improvement."

        "Answer": "No, X Inc.'s position is untenable. While it is true that lower estates are obliged to receive the waters that descend from higher estates, this pertains only to the waters which **naturally flow** from the higher estates and **without intervention of man** (Article 50, Water Code). The facts clearly state that the waters that descended from Village H is a result of an **artificial lagoon** constructed by X Inc.. The law also provides that the owner of the higher estate cannot make works which will increase the natural flow of waters.

The cause for his disinheritance is not one of those grounds listed by law as grounds to disinherit a child or descendant (Article 919, Civil Code). The ground for disinheritance related to accusation requires the child to have accused the testator of a crime for which the law prescribes imprisonment for six years or more, and the accusation must have been found groundless.

        "Answer": "No, the position of Mr. P is **not correct**. The Statute of Frauds applies only to purely executory contracts. The exclusion of parol evidence in totally or partially executed contracts would promote fraud or bad faith,. In the case presented, there was already payment of 1% as earnest money, which is considered part of the purchase price.

In a contract of guaranty or suretyship, any material alteration of the principal obligation without the consent of the guarantor or surety extinguishes the obligation of the surety or guarantor.

The liability of a surety is different from that of a guarantor because while the latter is entitled to the **benefit of excussion**, the former is not. Hence, the creditor may proceed directly against the surety without the need of going against the principal debtor.

Novation is the extinguishment of an obligation by substitution or change of the obligation by a subsequent one, which terminates the first (Article 1291, Civil Code).

Under Article 1816, all partners shall be liable **pro rata** with all their property only after all the partnership assets have been exhausted. The liability is not solidary unless the obligation falls under Articles 1822 and 1823. The contention of X, Y, and Z (lessees) that they may suspend the payment of rentals is correct.

If the bride’s non-appearance was malicious, reckless, or calculated to inflict pain, **moral damages** are recoverable. **Actual damages** for expenses incurred (like the wedding reception) may also be recovered under the principle of *solutio indebiti* or unjust enrichment."

        "Question": "A seller posted an online advertisement for a “4-volume set of Tolentino's Commentaries and Jurisprudence on the Civil Code of the Philippines, 100 pesos only.” A Bar candidate ordered it and paid through GCash. However, when the set was delivered, the author was Lorna Tolentino (the noted actor) instead of Arturo Tolentino (the legal luminary). The Bar candidate believes that the contract of sale should be rescinded and that damages are also proper. Is the Bar candidate’s position legally sound? Explain briefly.",
        "Answer": "No, the Bar candidate’s position is not legally sound. **Rescission** or resolution under Article 1191 is a principal remedy in case of a substantial breach of a reciprocal obligation. The seller did not commit a breach because they delivered the books as advertised. The candidate merely assumed the author was the legal luminary without any representation from the seller. Furthermore, rescission under Article 1381 is inapplicable as it is not based on lesion or fraud of creditors. The claim for **damages** is also unsound because there was no legal wrong committed by the seller, and it was incumbent upon the buyer to verify the details."

In coordination with Marie, the grandparents booked the party venue, signed the contracts with the caterer and the entertainers, finalized the guest list, and paid all amount due. Marie promised to them to bring Noel to the party. A week before the scheduled birthday party, Marie decided that she would not bring Noel to the party, and that she would instead take him on an out-of-town trip on the day of the party. Marie could not forget that her parents-in-law initially opposed Benedict’s marriage to her because she has a former burlesque dancer. The grandparents seek your advice on whether there is legal basis to hold Marie liable for the damages that they have suffered as a result of her acts. What is your advice? Explain briefly.

        "Answer": "I will advise the grandparents that they may seek damages from Marie on the basis of the principle in human relations that any person who willfully causes loss or injury to another in a manner that is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy shall compensate the latter for the damage.

In 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire family had to spend 24 hours together every day in their small house. Ranza observed that although Junsi continued to work from home to support the family, he began to exhibit paranoia, and constantly kept making sure that they always washed their hands and rubbed them with alcohol ten times before eating. Junsi also always wore a face mask, face shield and hazmat in the house, except when he was alone in the room. Junsi began sleeping separately from Ranza and their children. He believed that other people who wanted to meet him in person were actively trying to harm him by exposing him to the virus. In early 2022, Ranza filed a petition for declaration of nullity of her marriage with Junsi on the ground of psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code, citing his atypical behavior. She presented the testimony of a doctor, who proved that Junsi was suffering from psychotic paranoia due to intense stress, which accounted for his belief in things that are not real. Should Ranza's petition be granted? Explain briefly. (5 points)",

The land was part of the conjugal property of Nonoy and Daday, but was registered in Nonoy's name alone. The title was later transferred solely in the name of Nonoy. Daday died. When the children of Nonoy and Daday learned about the sale to Barby, they questioned its validity since Daday had not consented to the sale. Nonoy’s position is that Daday’s consent was not required because the property was registered in his name. Is the sale to Barby valid? Explain briefly. (5 points)",
        "Answer": "No, the sale to Barby is not valid. There is a presumption that all properties acquired during the marriage belong to the conjugal partnership whether the acquisition appears to have been made, contracted, or registered in the name of only one of the spouses. (Article 116, Family Code). Even if the property appears to be registered solely in the name of either spouse, it has the inherent character of conjugal property if it was acquired for valuable consideration during the marriage. (Cordova v. Ty, G.R. No. 246255. February 3, 2021). As part of the conjugal property of Nonoy and Daday, any disposition or encumbrance thereof must be made with the consent of both spouses. Hence, when Nonoy sold the land to Barby without the consent of Daday, the disposition is void under Article 124 of the Family Code."

Agaton entrusted the original copy of the 2013 will to Karl. In 2014, Karl joined a group of mercenaries to fight in Crimea alongside the Russians. After Russia's annexation of Crimea, Karl did not return to the Philippines and was never heard of. Five years later, in 2019, Agaton executed a codicil which provided the following: 'Because of the death of Karl, I revoke my 20 J 3 will. I hereby recognize Gian as my other illegitimate son, and hereby bequeath to him my entire estate.' Agaton died in 2020. During the probate of Agaton's 2019 codicil, Karl appeared in court, presented the 2013 will, contested the validity of its revocation, opposed the probate of the 2019 codicil, and sought the probate of the 2013 will. Both the 2013 will and 2019 codicil were immaculate as to form. (a) Did the 2019 codicil revoke the 2013 will? Explain briefly. (b) Distribute the estate of Agaton. Explain briefly. (5 points)",
        "Answer": "The 2019 Codicil did not revoke the 2013 will because the revocation was based on the mistaken belief that Karl was already dead, and revocation based on a false cause or an illegal cause is null and void (Article 833, Civil Code). The estate of Agaton shall be distributed in accordance with the rules on intestacy. Despite the invalidity of the revocation, the preterition of Gian in the 2013 will shall annul the institution of Karl because Gian is a compulsory heir in the direct line who was totally omitted. With the preterition of Gian, the 2013 will is intrinsically void and intestacy shall govern the distribution of Agaton's estate, thus Karl and Gian will get equal shares."

(a) Is there a penalty clause in the lease agreement? Explain briefly. (b) As between Jungkook and Gel, who is correct? Explain briefly. (5 points)",
        "Answer": "(a) Yes, there is a penalty clause in the lease agreement. The clause making Gel liable to pay Jungkook five monthly rentals and attorney's fees in case of breach is clearly a penalty clause as it is intended to substitute the indemnity for damages and payment of interests in case of non-compliance (Article 1226, Civil Code). (b) Gel is correct. Since the parties have already provided for the penalty clause that should be paid by the lessee in case of non-compliance, the penalty clause shall be the measure of the indemnity to be paid to the lessor, Jungkook, in case the lessee commits a breach of the terms of the lease.

        "Answer": "An **immovable property** cannot be transported from place to place, whereas **movable property** can be transported from place to place without impairment of the real property to which they are fixed. Examples of immovable property include lands, buildings, and construction of all kinds adhered to the soil, and fertilizer actually used on a piece of land. Examples of movable property are forces of nature which are brought under control by science and obligations and actions which have for their object movables or demandable sums."

Flor's title was issued prior in time but was based on a dubious and fake survey plan. (a) Discuss the principle of “qui prior est tempore, prior est jure” in the Torrens system of land registration. (b) As between Flor and de Luna, whose title should be declared valid and whose title should be voided? Explain briefly. (5 points)",
        "Answer": "(a) The principle of 'qui prior est tempore, potior est jure' literally means he who is before in time is better in right. (Benavides vs. Salvador, G.R. No. 173331 December 11, 2013). Under the Torrens System, this generally means that in case of conflict between two certificates of title covering the same land, the one earlier in date prevails (Yu vs. Ayala Land, Inc., G.R. No. 173120; 10 April 2019). (b) De Luna's title should be declared valid and Flor's title voided. Although Flor's title was issued earlier, it was derived from an illegal proceeding based on a dubious, irregularly approved, and fake survey plan. A title derived from a void proceeding cannot prevail, and the rule 'qui prior est tempore' applies only when both titles were issued pursuant to judicial proceedings exercising proper jurisdiction.

The OSG argues the documents are insufficient. Should the petition for reconstitution be granted? Explain briefly. (5 points)",
        "Answer": "No, the petition for reconstitution should not be granted. In a petition for reconstitution, the necessary quantum of evidence is clear and convincing evidence. The LRA Report, which is vital to the reconstitution petition and pertains to the technical description, must be supported by the testimony of the public officer who issued it, otherwise the report is hearsay and lacks probative value. Since the public officer was not called upon to testify and be examined, the evidence is insufficient, and the petition must be denied."

The mortgage provides for a 5% monthly interest, a five-year maturity period, a default provision in case of non-payment of interest or principal, and an extrajudicial foreclosure provision. On the fourth year, Ely fails to pay interest for three consecutive months. After demand, Mia declares Ely in default and extrajudicially forecloses the mortgage, and Mia consolidates ownership. Can Ely have the foreclosure annulled and recover the property? Explain briefly. (5 points)",
        "Answer": "Yes, Ely can have the foreclosure sale annulled and recover the property. The stipulation for 5% monthly interest is exorbitant and unconscionable. The excessive interest rate taints the obligation and should be reduced to the legal rate (6% per annum). Ely was not given an opportunity to settle his debt at the correct amount (i.e., excluding the iniquitous interest). A judgment ordering a foreclosure sale is conditioned upon a finding on the correct amount of the unpaid obligation and the failure of the debtor to pay the said amount. (Heirs of Espiritu v.

At that time, their child, Amado, was only 18 months old. Lila and Christopher returned to the Philippines and settled in El Nido, Palawan. Christopher allegedly promised to give support to Amado in the amount of US$1,000 per month, but he never did. Subsequently, Christopher also settled in Cebu where he cohabited with another Filipino woman. When Lila learned of the whereabouts of Christopher, she filed a complaint against him for violation of the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act for his refusal to support Amado. Lila also invoked Article 195 of the Family Code, which provides for those who are obliged to support each other. She argued that notwithstanding their divorce, Christopher is not excused from complying with his obligation to support Amado. Is Lila correct in Invoking Article 195 of the Family Code? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, Lila is not correct in invoking Article 195 of the Family Code. While it is true that under Article 195 of the Family Code, the father is obliged to support his legitimate and illegitimate children, the defendant, Christopher, is a foreign citizen and he shall be governed by his own national law. The nationality principle under Article 15 of the Civil Code in relation to the Family Code provisions on support applies only to Filipino citizens. By analogy, the same principle applies to foreigners in that they are governed by their national law with respect to their family rights and duties."

When Maricel was 10 years old, Aurora died so Nina came home to the Philippines with Maricel for the funeral. Maricel finally met Mikael who is now 28 years old. The two of them fell in love and planned to get married. Nina objected, saying that their marriage was prohibited by law. Can Maricel and Mikael validly get married? Explain your answer.",
        "Answer": "Yes, Maricel and Mikael can validly get married. Under the Family Code, one of the marriages considered void by reason of public policy is a marriage between a legitimate child and an adopted child of the adopter. In the problem, Mikael was legally adopted by Nina. Maricel, however, is an illegitimate child of Nina, having been born out of an adulterous affair. Since the prohibition under paragraph 7 of Article 38 of the Family Code is a marriage between an adopted child and a legitimate child of the adopter, Mikael can validly marry Maricel because the latter is an illegitimate child of Nina."

The couple lived together until 2007 when JR confessed to having an affair with Elena. Inka later discovered that JR and Elena got married in 1995. Inka thus filed a criminal complaint against JR for Bigamy. In his defense, JR insisted that he could not be held criminally liable for Bigamy because his marriage with Inka in 1981 is void for lack of a valid marriage license, while his marriage with Elena is void for lack of a marriage ceremony. Meanwhile, Elena claimed that even prior to the Bigamy case, she already filed a petition for nullity of marriage before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City sometime in 2007 after learning about the marriage between JR and Inka. The RTC later declared the marriage of JR and Sena as void for being bigamous, and the ruling attained finality due to lack of appeal. Does JR have a valid defense in the Bigamy case? Decide with reasons.",
        "Answer": "Yes, JR has a valid defense in the bigamy case. Article 40 of the Family Code provides that the absolute nullity of a previous marriage may be invoked for purposes of remarriage on the basis solely of a final judgment declaring such previous marriage void. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that the requirement of seeking a judicial declaration of nullity of a previous marriage under Article 40 of the Family Code applies only for purposes of remarriage, and it is not intended to preclude an accused in a bigamy case from raising the nullity of his marriage as a defense. Furthermore, a judicial declaration of absolute nullity is not necessary to prove a prior or subsequent void *ab initio* marriage in a bigamy case. Thus, JR has a valid defense in the bigamy case."

The purchases were mainly due to the successful salon and water refilling business of Lucia. Unfortunately, the records of these purchases were destroyed during Typhoon Ondoy in 2009. In 2023, their relationship turned sour and Lucia now wants to part ways with Santiago. However, there is a disagreement on how to divide their properties. Lucia filed a case in the Family Court, claiming that she is entitled to all of the properties. Is Lucia correct? Explain briefly.",
        "Answer": "No, Lucia is not correct. The couple's property relations are governed by the rules on co-ownership under the Family Code, as they are a man and a woman capacitated to marry each other who lived exclusively as husband and wife without the benefit of marriage. Under these rules, their wages and salaries shall be owned by them in equal shares. Furthermore, property acquired while they lived together shall be presumed to have been obtained by their joint efforts, work or industry, and shall be owned by them in equal shares. Although Lucia claims the purchases were mainly due to her business, the presumption of equal sharing applies, meaning Lucia is not entitled to all the properties."

Juliette lived with her mother until Anna married Karenina, a businesswoman. Melchor died intestate. Juliette, now 20 years old, filed an action to establish her illegitimate filiation, Juliette presented her birth certificate signed by Melchor, as well as photographs of her with Melchor in their home in North Greenhills. Amy, Anna, and Karenina opposed the action of Juliette. Will the action of Juliette prosper? Explain your answer.",
        "Answer": "Yes, the action of Juliette will prosper. An illegitimate child may prove filiation by presenting a record of birth appearing in the Civil Register or a public document acknowledging the child's filiation. The rule requiring the action to be filed during the putative parent's lifetime applies only when the claim is based on open and continuous possession of the status of an illegitimate child. In this case, Juliette presented a birth certificate duly signed by Melchor, which serves as a proof of filiation under Article 172 of the Family Code. Thus, she can still prove her illegitimate filiation despite Melchor's death."

Anita was able to provide a house, a nanny, and other necessities for Marisol. Billy, however, insisted that Anita no longer needed to work if she and Marisol stayed with him as he could provide for them. Since Anita refused to live with Billy, the latter filed a petition for custody of Marisol.

        "Answer": "If I were the judge, I would deny the petition filed by Billy. Marisol is an illegitimate child, and Article 176 of the Family Code vests sole parental authority and custody upon the mother.

When they finished their studies and started earning, they decided to invest in a condominium unit together which they hoped to lease out. Since Niccolo came from a rich family and was still receiving an allowance from his parents, the couple decided that Niccolo would shell out 2/3 (P10 million) of the P15 million purchase price, while Meann would contribute 1/3 (P5 million). They asked a mutual friend who was a law student to draw up a contract which reflected the mentioned interests. The contract also had a provision that their shares in the benefits as well as the charges affecting the property would be equal. They then found a long-term tenant who rented the property for P30,000 a month. Unfortunately, Niccolo and Meann broke up and are now quarreling over their respective shares in the rental income. Niccolo insists that he should get P20,000 or 2/3 of the monthly income while Meann claims that it should be P15,000 each. Who is correct? Explain your answer.",
        "Answer": "Niccolo is correct. The parties became co-owners of the condominium unit, and the law on co-ownership provides that the share of the co-owners in the benefits and charges shall be proportional to their respective interests. Any stipulation in a contract to the contrary shall be void. Since Niccolo contributed 2/3 (P10 million) of the purchase price, and Meann contributed 1/3 (P5 million), their shares in the P30,000 monthly income must be proportional to their contributions. Niccolo's 2/3 share amounts to P20,000."

Shortly after, the Spouses Cruz filed an ejectment case against Ildefonso and Bienvenido, arguing that since the other heirs had sold 3/4 of the property, they were entitled to the possession of the property. Is the position of the Spouses Cruz tenable? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, the position of the Spouses Cruz is not tenable. Upon the death of Lani and Rufino, their children became co-owners of the estate in equal shares. Since the property remained undivided, no co-owner may exclusively possess a specific portion. Bugoy, as a co-owner, could validly sell only his ideal or pro-indiviso share in the property owned in common. The alienation made by a co-owner is limited to the portion that may be allotted to him in the division upon termination of the co-ownership. Therefore, the Spouses Cruz acquired only Bugoy’s undivided interest and are not entitled to the exclusive possession of the property to the exclusion of Ildefonso and Bienvenido."

The surrounding property closest to the public highway is owned by Renato. Willing to pay compensation, Marvic talked to Renato about granting him access to the highway but Renato refused. Renato reasoned that there is another access point for Marvic through a dirt road that connects to the public highway without passing through his property. Marvic argued that this is not convenient as it is twice the distance, circuitous, and unlit. As they could not reach an agreement, Marvic filed a complaint for easement of right of way against Renato. Should a compulsory right of way be granted In favor of Marvic? Explain your answer.",
        "Answer": "No, Marvic should not be granted a compulsory right of way over Renato's property. To be entitled to a compulsory easement of right of way, the dominant estate must prove, among other requirements, that the property is surrounded by other immovables *without adequate outlet* to a public highway. The facts indicate that Marvic has another access point through a dirt road connecting to the public highway, meaning the property is not without adequate outlet. The argument that the existing access is inconvenient because it is twice the distance, circuitous, and unlit does not justify imposing the easement on Renato’s property, as Marvic is not landlocked."

Explain your answer.",
        "Answer": "The donation is **void**. Under Article 739 of the Civil Code, donations made between persons guilty of adultery or concubinage at the time of the donation are void. Since Alejandro was married and had a clandestine affair (adultery/concubinage) with Francisca, and the donation was made while this illegal relation existed, the donation is void by reason of public policy.

They argued that Euriz is an illegitimate child who has no right to inherit from the legitimate relatives of his father, Enrico. Is the opposition of the legitimate heirs of Hilario correct? Explain your answer.",
        "Answer": "No, the legitimate heirs of Hilario are not correct. While Article 992 of the Civil Code traditionally prohibited illegitimate children from inheriting *ab intestato* from the legitimate relatives of their parents (the 'iron curtain rule'), the Supreme Court has recently adopted a construction making children, regardless of birth status, qualified to inherit from their direct ascendants by right of representation. This interpretation makes Article 992 consistent with the Family Code, which mandates support from grandparents to grandchildren regardless of status. Since Euriz is seeking to represent her deceased parent (Enrico) from her grandfather's (Hilario's) estate, Article 982 applies, which provides that grandchildren and other descendants shall inherit by right of representation, without distinguishing between legitimate or illegitimate grandchildren.

Jhosep failed to pay on the stipulated date. On March 1, 2016, Mario filed a collection suit against Jhosep. In his defense, Jhosep stated that he was not yet in legal delay, as Mario had not made a demand against him. Is the contention of Jhosep correct? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, the contention of Jhosep is not correct. While judicial or extrajudicial demand is generally required to incur delay, demand is not necessary when the obligation or the law expressly states otherwise. The promissory note explicitly provides that upon failure to pay the principal on December 31, 2015, Jhosep agrees to pay 6% monthly interest from the 'date of default'. The parties clearly stipulated that default commences upon maturity of the obligation, which was January 1, 2016 (the day following the due date). Therefore, demand was waived, and Jhosep incurred liability for the stipulated interest from January 1, 2016.

Dation in payment is the conveyance of ownership of a thing by the debtor to the creditor as an accepted equivalent of performance of an obligation. For dacion en pago to exist, there must be a transfer of ownership of the thing, and the creditor must consent to receive the thing as payment for the debt.

Will Martina be able to invoke the principle first in time, stronger in right as against Juancho? Discuss.",
        "Answer": "No, Martina will not be able to invoke the principle of first in time, stronger in right as against Juancho. Under the rule on double sale of immovable property (Article 1544, Civil Code), ownership belongs to the person who in **good faith** first recorded the sale in the Registry of Property. Registration must be coupled with good faith. Since Martina learned of the prior sale to Juancho before she registered her deed of absolute sale, this knowledge taints her prior registration with bad faith. Because Martina acted in bad faith when she registered the deed, registration will not confer upon her ownership or a better right over Juancho."

        "Question": "Rene and Sebastian, who are bitter enemies, engaged in a gunfight. In the ensuing battle, Rene killed Sebastian with a shot to the head. In the criminal case for Murder filed against Rene, the heirs of Sebastian failed to establish funeral expenses due to the inadequacy of the evidence. Still, the trial court awarded temperate damages to the heirs, declaring that it cannot close its eyes to the fact that the heirs of Sebastian indeed incurred funeral expenses. Is the award proper? Discuss.",
        "Answer": "Yes, the award is proper. **Temperate damages** may be recovered if the court finds that some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount cannot be proved with certainty. In cases where actual expenses are not duly proven, temperate damages may be awarded in lieu of actual damages. In death indemnity cases, it is undeniable that the heirs incurred pecuniary losses, such as funeral expenses, and even in the absence of receipts, temperate damages equivalent to the amount usually spent for funeral services should be awarded."

        "Question": "Carlos and Chloe scheduled their intimate wedding on September 4, 2024 at 7:00 p.m. in Manila. Chloe purchased from Angelica a gold wedding ring with engraving Love, Carlos for PHP 1,000,000.00. Angelica promised to deliver the ring on or before the wedding day. On September 1, 2024, a weather bulletin warned that super typhoon Enfeng will enter the country within three days. On September 4, 2024 at 6:00 a.m., typhoon Enteng and the enhanced southwest monsoon caused massive flooding that rendered major roads in Manila impassable to all kinds of vehicles. Angelica failed to deliver the ring in time for Carlos and Chloe's wedding which pushed through despite the typhoon. Angelica delivered the ring the following day after the flood subsided. Chloe filed against Angelica a complaint for damages. Angelica denied liability and argued that typhoon is a fortuitous event. Chloe replied that typhoon is not a fortuitous event because its arrival was earlier announced. In any event, the typhoon will not exempt Angelica because of her negligence and default. Angelica was negligent when she failed to pay attention to the forecast and was in default when she delivered the ring after the wedding. Is Angelica liable for damages due to default In complying with her obligation? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Yes, Angelica is liable for damages for failing to comply with her obligation to deliver the ring. Time was the controlling motive for the obligation, and thus, time was of the essence, making demand unnecessary to put the debtor in default (Article 1169, Civil Code). Angelica cannot use the typhoon (fortuitous event) as a defense because her default already occurred (delaying delivery past the agreed time, which was the wedding), and she was already in delay when the fortuitous event occurred."

        "Question": "Viada and Blanco are best friends. In July 2024, Blanco sold to Castan a parcel of land registered in Viada’s name. Blanco signed the deed of absolute sale in behalf of Viada and pretended as his agent. In August 2024, Viada executed a special power of attorney (SPA) authorizing Blanco to sell the identical parcel of land. Blanco executed a deed of absolute sale in favor of Sanchez Roman who was aware of the prior conveyance of the same land to Castan. Thereafter, Castan learned of the subsequent transaction between Blanco and Sanchez Roman. Castan then filed against Sanchez Roman an action for annulment of sale. Castan argued that Sanchez Roman is in bad faith because of his knowledge of the prior sale. Sanchez Roman countered that the sale between Blanco and Castan is void for lack of Viada’s consent. Castan replied that the subsequent issuance of the SPA to Blanco ratified any defect in their transaction. Who between Castan and Sanchez Roman has a better right over the parcel of land? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Sanchez Roman has a better right over the parcel of land. The initial sale to Castan was unenforceable because Blanco, pretending to be Viada's agent, acted without authority (Article 1403 (1), Civil Code). The subsequent issuance of the SPA to Blanco did not ratify the initial sale because ratification must take place before the expiration of the period within which the action for annulment may be commenced. Since the first sale was unenforceable, the rules on double sale (Article 1544) do not apply, and Sanchez Roman's purchase, made under a valid SPA, prevails."

Each of them contributed P500,000.00 to the purchase price. The deed of absolute sale named both of them as buyers. However, the title was issued only in the name of Alice who fraudulently concealed the issuance of the title from Sheila. In 2024, Alice claimed that the property belongs exclusively to her and asked Sheila to vacate the property. Sheila filed an action to recover her share in the property from Alice. Alice moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action has prescribed. Sheila countered that prescription did not run because she was in continuous and actual possession of the land. Is Sheila’s action to recover her share in the property from Alice already prescribed? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, Sheila’s action to recover her share in the property from Alice has not yet prescribed. If property is acquired through mistake or fraud, the person obtaining it is considered a trustee of an implied trust (Article 1456, Civil Code). The action for reconveyance based on implied trust generally prescribes in ten (10) years, reckoned from the date of title issuance, when the adverse party repudiates the trust. However, an exception applies when the party seeking reconveyance is in actual, continuous, and peaceful possession of the property, as the action is then in the nature of a suit for quieting of title, which is imprescriptible. Since Sheila was in continuous possession, her action is imprescriptible."

In 2020, Sheena assigned to Colet her rights and obligations under the contract of lease. Colet then paid the agreed rentals to Maloi. In 2023, Colet paid PHP 10,000.00 monthly rent through postdated checks but were dishonored for having been drawn against a closed account. Maloi charged Colet with the crime of estafa. On the other hand, Maloi demanded from Sheena the unpaid rentals and stipulated increase in rent but was refused. Sheena denied liability and argued that her obligation was already extinguished when Colet substituted her as lessee. Sheena added that Maloi accepted rental payments from Colet. Did novation extinguish Sheena's obligation under the contract of lease? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, novation did not extinguish Sheena's obligation. To effect novation by substitution of debtor, the creditor must consent to release the original debtor (Article 1293, Civil Code). Maloi's mere acceptance of rental payments from Colet cannot be assumed as an express agreement to release Sheena from liability under the lease contract and accept Colet as the new debtor."

Diana hesitated because she has no money and is drowning in debts. Yet, Jesse promised to provide for all of Diana's needs. Jesse and Diana then lived together. The following day, Jesse and Diana bought a brand-new car. The vehicle was exclusively registered under Diana's name. Celeste learned of the purchase and filed an action to recover the vehicle from Diana. Celeste claimed that Jesse is still her lawful husband, and that the car is part of their community property. Diana countered that she and Jesse are co-owners of the vehicle. Can Celeste recover the vehicle from Diana? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Yes, Celeste can recover the car from Diana. Since Jesse is still married to Celeste, his cohabitation with Diana is governed by Article 148 of the Family Code (parties not capacitated to marry). Under this regime, only property acquired through actual joint contribution is owned in common, but since Diana was only living with Jesse and unemployed, the presumption of equal contribution does not apply. As the funds used to buy the car were taken from the Absolute Community Property of Jesse and Celeste, Celeste can recover the car from Diana."

Lloyd underwent gender-affirming surgery to resemble the woman gender identity. Lloyd also changed his sex from “male” to female and his name from Lloyd” to Laida pursuant to Swedish law. Thereafter, Laida returned to the Philippines and married Miggy. Is the marriage between Miggy and Laida valid? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Yes, the marriage between Miggy and Laida is considered valid. Laida has been naturalized as a Swedish citizen prior to the gender-affirming surgery and change of name, which were done in accordance with Swedish law. Laida’s capacity to marry shall be governed by her national law (Swedish law), as the nationality principle in Article 15 of the Civil Code only applies to Filipino citizens.

Monica submitted her birth certificate where Patrick recognized her as his daughter. The heirs of Patrick opposed the complaint. Decide the case and explain.",
        "Answer": "Monica’s complaint must be dismissed. Monica is deemed a legitimate child of Anton and Steph because she was born during their marriage (Article 164, Family Code). Her legitimacy can only be impugned by the husband (Anton), and this action must be filed within the prescriptive period set by law. Furthermore, Monica is not the proper party to impugn her own legitimacy. The fact that Patrick signed the birth certificate is insufficient to overcome the presumption of Monica's legitimacy."

        "Answer": "Yes, Zion is entitled to the cash surrender value of his condominium purchased on installment. The Maceda Law grants a buyer who has paid at least two years of installments a cash surrender value of at least fifty percent (50%) of the total payments made. Zion started paying in April 2022 and defaulted in June 2024, meaning he made 26 monthly installment payments.

In his will, Caloy instituted Rebreb as the sole heir. How much can Rebreb receive from Caloy’s estate? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Rebreb can receive P34,285,714 from Caloy's estate. The institution of Rebreb as sole heir is annulled due to the preterition of the legitimate children (Teddy and Bobbie) and spouse (Grace), who are compulsory heirs in the direct line (Article 854, Civil Code). Consequently, the estate is distributed by intestate succession. The net estate of P240 million is divided among the surviving spouse, legitimate children, and illegitimate child. Following the proportions they inherit in the legitime (where the illegitimate child gets half the share of a legitimate child, and the spouse gets the same share as one legitimate child), the P240M estate is divided into seven parts (2 parts each for Teddy and Bobbie, 2 parts for Grace, and 1 part for Rebreb). Rebreb receives one part, amounting to P34,285,714."

In the mortgage contract, Rico appointed Maris as attorney-in-fact for the purpose of selling the land in case of default in the payment of loan. Rico failed to pay his obligation. Maris then purchased the land from Rico through a deed of absolute sale. Later, Rico questioned the mortgage contract because it violates the prohibition against pactum commisorium. As such, the subsequent sale is void. Is the subsequent sale void due to the prohibition against pactum commissorium? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, the subsequent sale is not void due to the prohibition against *pactum commissorium*. *Pactum commissorium* prohibits the automatic appropriation of the pledged or mortgaged property by the creditor upon default (Article 2088, Civil Code). The subsequent sale here was not automatic; it required a new deed of absolute sale. While the stipulation appointing Maris as attorney-in-fact for the sale is void because an agent cannot acquire the property subject of the agency without the principal's consent (Article 1491(2), Civil Code), the ensuing sale itself does not violate the prohibition on *pactum commissorium*."

Can Jackie rescind the contract of sale between Kiko and Bogs for the alleged violation of her right of first refusal? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, Jackie cannot rescind the contract of sale between Kiko and Bogs. The letter from Kiko was merely an offer to sell or a unilateral promise to sell, not a right of first refusal, as it was not part of the lease stipulations. Kiko offered P1,000,000.00, but Jackie’s counter-offer of P800,000.00 was not accepted, meaning no contract was perfected between them. Furthermore, Jackie gave no separate consideration for the option to buy, so Kiko was free to withdraw the offer anytime before acceptance (Article 1324, Civil Code). Thus, Jackie has no right of first refusal and no cause for rescission."

The land was classified as alienable and disposable public land in 2015. Klyde presented evidence that his predecessor-in-interest has been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation since 1990. The RD denied Klyde's application and argued that the possession should be counted from 2015 when the land was declared alienable and disposable. Is the Register of Deeds justified in denying Klyde’s application? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Yes, the Register of Deeds is justified in denying Klyde’s application. The RD lacks jurisdiction over land registration proceedings, which belong to the courts (Section 17, P.D. 1529). Assuming the RD had jurisdiction, the application was still properly denied because possession can only be counted from the time the land was declared alienable and disposable (2015). Klyde's possession prior to 2015 is not counted. Thus, from 2015 to 2020, Klyde only possessed the land for five years, which is short of the thirty (30) years generally required for acquisition by prescription of alienable public land, rendering the application unmeritorious."

Although the four-year absence period required by Article 41 of the Family Code has been met, Calista failed to show that she has a 'well-founded belief' that Sergio is already dead. This 'well-founded belief' requires diligent and honest-to-goodness efforts and inquiries to ascertain the absent spouse’s whereabouts and whether they are still alive or dead.

The disposition in favor of 'the poor in general' is valid and deemed limited to the poor living in the testator’s domicile at the time of his death (Article 1030, Civil Code).

The rules on double sale (Article 1544) apply only when there are two or more transactions constituting **valid sales** over the same subject matter. The agreement between Odrey and Jeboy is a **contract to sell**, as Odrey reserved ownership and only agreed to transfer title upon full payment of the price.

The award of damages shall earn interest at the rate of 12% from filing of the complaint until finality of the decision. SO ORDERED. Did the trial court properly impose the civil liabilities of Alan and RSA? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, the trial court did not properly impose the civil liabilities upon Alan and RSA. The liability of the employer (RSA) for the quasi-delict of its employee (Alan) is **direct and primary**, as it is presumed negligent in the selection and supervision of its employees (Article 2180, Civil Code). The liability of joint tortfeasors (Alan and RSA) is **solidary** (Article 2194). Thus, RSA should have been held primarily and solidarily liable, not merely subsidiarily. Additionally, the legal interest rate applied to damages arising from quasi-delict is **6% per annum**, reckoned from the finality of the judgment until its satisfaction.

Dr. Fuentes left for the United States, became a naturalized American citizen, and died in New York in 2007. The laws of New York do not recognize holographic wills or compulsory heirs. Can the holographic will of Dr. Fuentes be admitted to probate in the Philippines? Why or why not?",
        "Answer": "Yes, the holographic will of Dr. Fuentes may be admitted to probate in the Philippines because there is no public policy violated by such probate. The only issue at probate is the due execution of the will which includes the formal validity of the will. As regards formal validity, the court will resolve whether the will was executed in accordance with the form prescribed by the law observed by the testator in the execution of his will. For purposes of probate in the Philippines, an alien testator may observe the law of the place where the will was executed, or the formalities of the law of the place where he resides, or according to the formalities of the law of his own country, or in accordance with the Philippine Civil Code. Since Dr. Fuentes executed his will in accordance with the Philippine law, the Philippine court shall apply the NCC in determining the formal validity of the holographic will."

The national law of the testator determines who his heirs are, the order that they succeed, how much their successional rights are, and whether or not a testamentary disposition in his will is valid. Since Dr. Fuentes was a US citizen, the laws of New York determine who his heirs are. And since the New York law does not recognize the concept of compulsory heirs, Jay is not a compulsory heir of Dr. Fuentes entitled to a legitime."

Deeply embarrassed, Roberto sued the hotel for damages under Arts. 19 and 21 of the NCC. Will Roberto’s action prosper? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, Roberto’s action will not prosper. To give rise to a cause of action under Art. 19 of the NCC, it is necessary that there must be a legal right or duty which is exercised in bad faith for the sole intent of prejudicing another. On the other hand, under Art. 21 one is liable for damages if he wilfully causes loss or injury to another in a manner which is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy. Based on the facts, bad faith cannot be assumed on the part of the hotel because it had basis to deny entry to the reception to one who is not in the guest list. Secondly, the act of denying entry cannot be considered contrary to morals, good customs or public policy or that the hotel wilfully caused Roberto loss or injury. On the contrary, Roberto was the one who appears to have acted in bad faith since he wilfully entered the reception knowing that he is not one of the invited guests."

Pietro survived. Can Marian’s baby be the beneficiary of the insurance taken on the life of the mother?",
        "Answer": "Yes, the baby can be the beneficiary of the life insurance of Marian. Art. 40, NCC provides that 'birth determines personality; but the conceived child shall be considered born for all purposes that are favorable to it, provided that it be born later with the conditions specified in Art. 41, NCC. Art. 41 states that 'for civil purposes, the fetus shall be considered born if it is alive at the time it is completely delivered from the mother's womb. However, if the fetus had an intra-uterine life of less than seven months, it is not deemed born if it dies within 24 hours after its complete delivery from the maternal womb.' The act of naming the unborn child as sole beneficiary in the insurance is favorable to the conceived child and therefore the fetus acquires presumptive or provisional personality. However, said presumptive personality only becomes conclusive if the child is born alive. The child need not survive for 24 hours as required under Art. 41 of the Code because 'Marian was already due to give birth,' indicating that the child was more than 7 months old."

However, Angela died 20 hours after birth. Ricky sought to recover the P1 million. Is Ricky entitled to recover? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Yes, Ricky is entitled to recover the P1 million. The NCC considers a fetus a person for purposes favorable to it provided it is born later. While the donation is favorable to the fetus, the donation did not take effect because the fetus was not born in accordance with the NCC. To be considered born, the fetus that had an intra-uterine life of less than 7 months should live for 24 hours from its complete delivery from the mother’s womb. Since Angela had an intra-uterine life of less than 7 months but did not live for 24 hours, she was not considered born and, therefore, did not become a person.

They married without their parents’ knowledge before an unsuspecting judge. After the couple has been in cohabitation for 6 years, Linda’s parents filed an action to annul the marriage on ground of lack of parental consent. Will the case prosper? (a) No, since only the couple can question the validity of their marriage after they became 21 of age; their cohabitation also convalidated the marriage. (b) No, since Linda’s parents made no allegations that earnest efforts have been made to come to a compromise with Conrad and Linda and which efforts failed. (c) Yes, since the marriage is voidable, the couple being below 21 years of age when they married. (d) Yes, since Linda’s parents never gave their consent to the marriage.",

They paid money to the pastor who took care of all the documentation. When Angelina wanted to go to the U.S., she found out that there was no marriage license issued to them before their marriage. Since their marriage was solemnized in 1995 after the effectivity of the Family Code, Angelina filed a petition for judicial declaration of nullity on the strength of a certification by the Civil Registrar of Manila that, after a diligent and exhaustive search, the alleged marriage license indicated in the marriage certificate does not appear in the records and cannot be found. Decide the case and explain.",
        "Answer": "The marriage of Brad and Angelina should be declared void. One of the formal requisites of a marriage is a marriage license, the total absence of which will render the marriage void. The absence of the marriage license was certified by the local civil registrar who is the official custodian of these documents and who is in the best position to certify as to the existence of these records. Also, there is a presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty."

Since Irma was already eight months pregnant by Isidro, she pleaded to the hijackers to allow the assistant pilot to solemnize her marriage with Isidro. Soon after the marriage, Isidro expired. As the plane landed in Libya Irma gave birth. However, the baby died a few minutes after complete delivery. Back in the Philippines Irma immediately filed a claim for inheritance. The parents of Isidro opposed her claim contending that the marriage was void ab initio on the following grounds: (a) They had not given their consent to the marriage of their son; (b) There was no marriage license; (c) The solemnizing officer had no authority to perform the marriage; and (d) The solemnizing officer did not file an affidavit of marriage with the proper civil registrar. Resolve each of the contentions.",
        "Answer": "(a) The fact that the parents of Isidro and of Irma did not give their consent to the marriage did not make the marriage void ab initio. The marriage is merely voidable under Art 45, FC. (b) Absence of marriage license did not make the marriage void ab initio. Since the marriage was solemnized in articulo mortis, it was exempt from the license requirement under Art. 31, FC. (c) On the assumption that the assistant pilot was acting for and in behalf of the airplane chief who was under disability, and by reason of the extraordinary and exceptional circumstances of the case, the marriage was solemnized by an authorized officer under Arts. 7(3) and 31, FC. (d) Failure of the solemnizing officer to file the affidavit of marriage did not affect the validity of the marriage.

When Eka could not take their marital situation anymore, she asked for a divorce. Du-guil agreed on the condition that Eka would be the one to file for divorce, and that the ground should be 'no fault'. After the divorce, Eka went back to the Philippines and filed a case to have the judgment of divorce recognized. The RTC denied Eka's petition because she alone filed for divorce, in violation of Art. 26(2) of the Family Code. According to the RTC, Art. 26 requires that either the foreign spouse alone initiates the filing of the divorce or, at the very least, Eka and Du-guil should have filed for divorce jointly. Is the RTC correct? Explain briefly.",
        "Answer": "No, the RTC is not correct. As ruled by the Court in Republic v. Manalo, it is irrelevant if the foreign or the Filipino spouse initiated the foreign divorce proceeding. Once a divorce decree is issued, the foreign spouse is deemed to have 'obtained' a divorce which capacitates him or her to remarry. Further in Abel v. Rule, reiterating Galapon v. Republic, the Court clarified that Art. 26 of the Family applies to mixed marriages where the divorce decree is obtained by the foreign spouse, obtained jointly by the Filipino and foreign spouse, and obtained solely by the Filipino spouse. Thus, the RTC committed an error in denying the petition."

        "Answer": "Yes, the Filipino wife may avail of Article 26 of the Family Code after an appropriate petition for the recognition of the foreign divorce has been granted by the Philippine court. In a mixed marriage, where a valid divorce is obtained abroad which capacitates the alien spouse to remarry, the Filipino spouse shall likewise be capacitated to remarry under Philippine law. However, a mere grant of divorce by a foreign tribunal does not automatically give effect to the divorce until it is recognized before Philippine courts. The starting point in any recognition of a foreign divorce judgment is the acknowledgment that our courts do not take judicial notice of foreign judgments and laws. This means that the foreign judgment and its authenticity must be proven as facts under our rules on evidence, together with the alien’s applicable national law."

F’s divorce petition was then granted by the Japanese court with finality. May the legal effects of the divorce decree be recognized in the Philippines, and consequently, capacitate F to remarry here? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Yes, the divorce obtained by F in Japan may be recognized here in the Philippines and capacitate F to remarry provided that she files the appropriate petition before Philippine courts for the recognition of the divorce decree. In Morisono v. Morisono the Supreme Court ruled there is no real and substantial difference between a Filipino who initiated a foreign divorce proceedings and a Filipino who obtained a divorce decree upon the instance of his or her alien spouse. Hence, to make a distinction between them based merely on the superficial difference of whether they initiated the divorce proceedings or not is utterly unfair. Foreign divorce decrees obtained to nullify marriages between a Filipino and an alien citizen may already be recognized in this jurisdiction, regardless of who."

Juliet promised she will be back the moment she becomes an American. After some time, Romeo learned from a friend that Juliet already became a U.S. citizen and even divorced him to marry a wealthy American businessman. Romeo filed a petition before the Regional Trial Court praying that an order be issued authorizing him to remarry pursuant to Art. 26, FC. Decide the petition with reasons.",
        "Answer": "The petition filed by Romeo should be granted. Art. 26 of the Family Code provides when a marriage between an alien and a Filipino is validly celebrated and a divorce is thereafter validly obtained by the alien spouse capacitating him or her to remarry, the Filipino shall likewise have the capacity to remarry under Philippine Law. In Republic v. Orbecido, the Supreme Court ruled that the reckoning point for the applicability of Art. 26 is not the citizenship of the parties at the time of the celebration of the marriage but their citizenship at the time the valid divorce is obtained by the alien spouse. The facts state that Juliet acquired American citizenship, hence, she may obtain a divorce abroad which if valid in accordance with her national law shall also be regarded as valid in the Philippines provided that the divorce is proven as a fact in accordance with the rules on evidence in an appropriate proceeding filed before our courts."

Unfortunately, Ted discovered that Annie and his friend Louie were having an affair. Deeply hurt, Ted returned to Canada and filed a petition for divorce which was granted. In December 2013, Ted decided to marry his childhood friend Corazon in the Philippines. In preparation for the wedding, Ted went to the Local Civil Registry of Quezon City where his marriage contract with Annie was registered. He asked the Civil Register to annotate the decree of divorce on his marriage contract with Annie.

The foreigner must file a petition under Rule 108, ROC and prove therein the fact of divorce by presenting an official copy attested by the officer having custody of the original. He must also prove that the court which issued the divorce has jurisdiction to issue it and the law of the foreign country on divorce."

However, this nationality principle applies only to Filipino citizens and cannot be imposed on foreigners. Laida has been naturalized as a Swedish citizen prior to the gender-affirming surgery and change of name which according to the given facts were done in accordance with Swedish law.

The only issue at probate is the due execution of the will which includes the formal validity of the will.

On the other hand, under Art. 21 one is liable for damages if he wilfully causes loss or injury to another in a manner which is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy. Based on the facts, bad faith cannot be assumed on the part of the hotel because it had basis to deny entry to the reception to one who is not in the guest list. Secondly, the act of denying entry cannot be considered contrary to morals, good customs or public policy or that the hotel wilfully caused Roberto loss or injury. On the contrary, Roberto was the one who appears to have acted in bad faith since he wilfully entered the reception of the wedding knowing that he is not one of the invited guests. Thus, Roberto’s action must fail."

While Gavin and Remy, who was then 7 months pregnant, were on their way to Calatagan, they figured in a car accident on 01 Dec. 2021 which resulted in the instantaneous death of Gavin and the premature delivery of Remy on the same day. At 8:30 A.M. on 03 Dec. 2021, the newborn baby died. Is the devise in favor of the baby valid? Explain briefly.",
        "Answer": "YES, the devise in favor of the baby is valid. Under the law birth determines personality, but the conceived child shall be considered born for all purposes favorable to the child provided it be born under the conditions specified in Art. 41. A fetus is considered born if it is alive at the time it is completely delivered from the mother’s womb. However, if the fetus had an intrauterine life of less than 7 months, for it to be considered born and possessed of juridical capacity, it must survive for 24 hours from complete separation from the mother’s womb. Based on the facts, Remy was already 7 months pregnant at the time she prematurely gave birth to her baby and that the baby was born alive and only died 2 days later.

When she was already due to give birth, she and her boyfriend Pietro, the father of her unborn child, were kidnapped in a resort in Bataan where they were vacationing. The military gave chase and after one (1) week, they were found in an abandoned hut in Cavite. Marian and Pietro were hacked with bolos. Marian and the baby were both found dead, with the baby’s umbilical cord already cut. Pietro survived. Can Marian’s baby be the beneficiary of the insurance taken on the life of the mother?",
        "Answer": "YES, the baby can be the beneficiary of the life insurance of Marian. Art. 40, NCC provides that 'birth determines personality; but the conceived child shall be considered born for all purposes that are favorable to it, provided that it be born later with the conditions specified in Art. 41, NCC. Art. 41 states that 'for civil purposes, the fetus shall be considered born if it is alive at the time it is completely delivered from the mother's womb. However, if the fetus had an intra-uterine life of less than seven months, it is not deemed born if it dies within 24 hours after its complete delivery from the maternal womb. The act of naming the unborn child as sole beneficiary in the insurance is favorable to the conceived child and therefore the fetus acquires presumptive or provisional personality. However, said presumptive personality only becomes conclusive if the child is born alive. The child need not survive for 24 hours as required under Art. 41 of the Code because 'Marian was already due to give birth,' indicating that the child was more than 7 months old."

Marian and the baby were both found dead, with the baby’s umbilical cord already cut. Pietro survived. Between Marian and the baby, who is presumed to have died ahead?",
        "Answer": "If the baby was not alive when completely delivered from the mother’s womb, it was not born as a person, then the question of who between two persons survived will not be an issue. Since the baby had an intra-uterine life of more than 7 months, it would be considered born if it was alive, at the time of its complete delivery from the mother’s womb. We can gather from the facts that the baby was completely delivered. But whether it was alive or not has to be proven by evidence. If the baby was alive when completely delivered from the mother’s womb, then it was born as a person and the question of who survived as between the baby and the mother shall be resolved by the provisions of the Rules of Court on Survivorship. This is because the question has nothing to do with succession. Obviously, the resolution of the question is needed just for the implementation of an insurance contract. Under Rule 113, Sec 3(jj(5)), ROC, as between the baby who was under 15 years old and Marian who was 18 years old, Marian is presumed to have survived. In both cases, therefore, the baby never acquired any right under the insurance policy. The proceeds of the insurance will then go to the estate of Marian."

However, Angela died 20 hours after birth. Ricky sought to recover the P1 million. Is Ricky entitled to recover? Explain.",
        "Answer": "YES, Ricky is entitled to recover the P1 million. The NCC considers a fetus a person for purposes favorable to it provided it is born later. (Art. 40, NCC) While the donation is favorable to the fetus, the donation did not take effect because the fetus was not born in accordance with the NCC. To be considered born, the fetus that had an intra-uterine life of less than 7 months should live for 24 hours from its complete delivery from the mother’s womb. Since Angela had an intra-uterine life of less than 7 months but did not live for 24 hours, she was not considered born and, therefore, did not become a person. (Art. 41, NCC) Not being a person, she has no juridical capacity to be a donee, hence, the donation to her did not take effect. The donation not being effective, the amount donated may be recovered.

After the divorce, Eka went back to the Philippines and filed a case to have the judgment of divorce recognized. The RTC denied Eka's petition because she alone filed for divorce, in violation of Art. 26(2) of the Family Code.

Once a divorce decree is issued, the foreign spouse is deemed to have 'obtained' a divorce which capacitates him or her to remarry. Further in Abel v. Rule, reiterating Galapon v.

In Morisono v. Morisono the Supreme Court ruled there is no real and substantial difference between a Filipino who initiated a foreign divorce proceedings and a Filipino who obtained a divorce decree upon the instance of his or her alien spouse.

A year thereafter, Wilma and Joseph returned and established permanent residence in the Philippines. If Harry hires you as his lawyer, what legal recourse would you advise him to take? Why?",
        "Answer": "I will advise Harry to file a petition for the recognition of the foreign divorce decree obtained by Wilma. He may file a petition for declaratory relief and move therein that Wilma was no longer a Filipino citizen at the time she secured the divorce and present evidence as the law of the foreign country on divorce and jurisdiction of the court which issued the divorce. I will also advise him to liquidate their properties."

Thus, Wilma went to a small country in Europe, became a naturalized citizen of that country, divorced Harry, and married Joseph. A year thereafter, Wilma and Joseph returned and established permanent residence in the Philippines. Harry tells you that he has fallen in love with another woman, Elizabeth, and wants to marry her because, after all, Wilma is already married to Joseph. Can Harry legally marry Elizabeth? Explain.",
        "Answer": "YES, he can marry Elizabeth. However, Harry needs to have the foreign judgment recognized. Article 26 of the Family Code gives the Filipino spouse the capacity to remarry if a divorce is validly obtained abroad by the alien spouse which capacitates the latter to remarry. In Orbecido, the Supreme Court held that the Filipino spouse is given the capacity to remarry even if it was not an originally mixed marriage because Orbecido’s wife was no longer a Filipino at the time she obtained the divorce decree. In the given problem, Wilma obtained divorce from Harry when the former was already a foreigner. Therefore, Harry can validly marry Elizabeth."

It appears that both in HK and MNS State first cousins could marry legally. They plan to reside and set up business in the Philippines. But they have been informed, however, that the marriage of first cousins here is considered void from the beginning by reason of public policy. They are in a dilemma.

Being foreigners, their status, conditions and legal capacity in the Philippines are governed by the law of Hong Kong, the country of which they are citizens.

Back in Manila, Anne discovered that Boni had been married in Bacolod City five (5) years earlier but divorced in Oslo only last year. His first wife was also a Filipina but now based in Sweden. Boni himself is a resident of Norway where he and Anne plan to live permanently. Anne retains your services to advise her on whether her marriage to Boni is valid under Philippine law? Is there anything else she should do under the circumstances?",
        "Answer": "If Boni is still a Filipino citizen, his legal capacity is governed by Philippine Law. (Art. 15, NCC) Under Philippine law, his marriage to Anne is void because of a prior existing marriage which was not dissolved by the divorce decreed in Oslo. Divorce obtained abroad by Filipino is not recognized. If Boni was no longer a Filipino citizen, the divorce is valid. Hence, his marriage to Anne is valid if celebrated in accordance with the law of the place where it was celebrated. Since the marriage was celebrated aboard a vessel of Norwegian registry, Norwegian law applies. If the Ship Captain has authority to solemnize the marriage aboard his ship, the marriage is valid and shall be recognized in the Philippines.

Her petition was granted by the church matrimonial court. What must Maria do to enable her to get married lawfully to another man under Philippine laws?",
        "Answer": "In Pulido v. People, the Supreme Court held that Art. 40 of the Family Code has retroactive application on marriages contracted prior to the effectivity of the Family Code but only for the purpose of remarriage, as the parties are not permitted to judge for themselves the nullity of their marriage. In other words, in order to remarry, a judicial declaration of nullity is required for prior marriages contracted before the effectivity of the Family Code. Without a judicial declaration of absolute nullity of the first marriage having been obtained, the second marriage is rendered void ab initio even though the first marriage is also considered void ab initio. The only basis for establishing the validity of the second marriage is the judicial decree of nullity of the first marriage. However, in a criminal prosecution for bigamy, the parties may still raise the defense of a void ab initio marriage even without obtaining a judicial declaration of absolute nullity if the first marriage was celebrated before the effectivity of the Family Code. In this case, Maria's marriage with Luis was celebrated when the Civil Code was in effect. Hence, she is required to obtain a judicial decree of absolute nullity of his prior void ab initio marriage but only for purposes of remarriage."

Under the Family Code, one of the marriages considered void by reason of public policy is a marriage between a legitimate child and an adopted child of the adopter. In the problem given, while Mikael was legally adopted by Nina. Maricel, on the other hand is a product of Nina's adulterous affair with a married man. Thus, Maricel is an illegitimate child of Nina.

When Faye reached 18 years of age, her parents forcibly took her back and arranged for her marriage to Brad. Although Faye lived with Brad after the marriage, Roderick continued to regularly visit Faye while Brad was away at work. During their marriage, Faye gave birth to a baby girl, Laica. When Faye was 25 years old, Brad discovered her continued liaison with Roderick and in one of their heated arguments, Faye shot Brad to death. She lost no time in marrying her true love Roderick, without a marriage license, claiming that they have been continuously cohabiting for more than five (5) years. Was the marriage of Roderick and Faye valid?",
        "Answer": "NO. The marriage of Roderick and Faye is not valid. Art. 4, FC provides that the absence of any of the essential or formal requisites renders the marriage void ab initio. However, no license shall be necessary for the marriage of a man and a woman who have lived together as husband and wife for at least five (5) years and without any legal impediment to marry each other. In Republic v. Dayot, reiterating the doctrine in Niñal v. Bayadog, this five-year period is characterized by exclusivity and continuity. In the present case, the marriage of Roderick and Faye cannot be considered as a marriage of exceptional character, because there were two legal impediments during their cohabitation: (1) minority on the part of Faye, during the first two years of cohabitation; and (2) lack of legal capacity, since Faye married Brad at the age of 18. Accordingly, the required five-year cohabitation period was not met for not being continuous and exclusive.

Is the marriage of Facundo and Quercia valid, despite the absence of a marriage license? Explain.",

The cohabitation of Facundo and Quercia from the time of death of Petra up to the time of their marriage on 01 July 2002 met the five-year cohabitation requirement therefore making their marriage despite the lack of a marriage license valid."

        "Answer": "The marriage between Gigi and Ric is void because a minister has no authority to solemnize a marriage between contracting parties who were both not members of the minister's religious sect. Under the Family Code, a minister or a priest has authority to solemnize a marriage but only if one or both contracting parties are members of the religious sect of the priest or minister. Since neither Ric nor Gigi was a member of the Baptist Church because both of them were Catholic, the Baptist Minister did not have authority to solemnize their marriage. Ric and Gigi cannot claim that they believed in good faith and that the Baptist Minister had the authority to solemnize the marriage and invoke Art. 35(2), FC to make the marriage valid. The provision of the Family Code applies only to a mistake of fact, and not to a mistake of law. Hence the fact that the Minister's license was expired will not affect the validity of the marriage if Ric or Gigi believed in good faith that the Minister had a valid license. That would be a mistake of fact. However, believing that the Minister had authority to solemnize the marriage even if none of the contracting parties was a member of the Minister's religious sect is a mistake of law. This is because the law expressly provides that the Minister has authority only if one or both contracting parties are members of the Minister's religious sect. (Art. 7(2), FC) A mistake of law does not excuse from non-compliance."

His second, with Carla, produced two (2) sons: Jon and Ryan. His third, with Elena, bore him no children although Elena has a daughter, Jane, from a previous relationship. His last, with Fe, produced no biological children but they informally adopted without court proceedings, Sandy's now 13 years old, whom they consider as their own. Sandy was orphaned as a baby and was entrusted to them by the midwife who attended Sandy's birth. All the children, including Amy, now live with Andrew in his house. Can Jon and Jane legally marry?",
        "Answer": "YES. Jon and Jane can marry each other; Jon is an illegitimate child of Andrew while Jane is a child of Elena from a previous relationship. Thus, their marriage is not one of the prohibited marriages enumerated under Art. 38, FC."

        "Question": "In 1981, JR married then 16-year-old Inka in a civil ceremony solemnized by the Mayor in their hometown. The couple lived together until 2007 when JR confessed to having an affair with Elena. Inka later discovered that JR and Elena got married in 1995. Inka thus filed a criminal complaint against JR for Bigamy. In his defense, JR insisted that he could not be held criminally liable for Bigamy because his marriage with Inka in 1981 is void for lack of a valid marriage license, while his marriage with Elena is void for lack of a marriage ceremony. Meanwhile, Elena claimed that even prior to the Bigamy case, she already filed a petition for nullity of marriage before the RTCJ of Quezon City sometime in 2007 after learning about the marriage between JR and Inka. The RTC later declared the marriage of JR and Elena as void for being bigamous, and the ruling attained finality due to lack of appeal. Does JR have a valid defense in the Bigamy case? Decide with reasons.",
        "Answer": "Yes, JR has a valid defense in the bigamy case. Art. 40 of the Family Code provides that the absolute nullity of a previous marriage may be invoked for purposes of remarriage on the basis solely of a final judgment declaring such previous marriage void. In the recent case of Pulido vs. People which involves a similar set of facts as in the problem presented, the Supreme Court ruled that the requirement of seeking a judicial declaration of nullity of a previous marriage under Art. 40 of the Family Code applies only for purposes of remarriage. It is not the intent of Art. 40 to preclude an accused in a bigamy case from raising the nullity of his marriage as a defense in a bigamy case. It would, thus, be unfair if the accused will not be permitted to raise such nullity in a prosecution for bigamy when the clear intent of Article 40 is to require such judicial decree of nullity only for the purpose of remarriage. Further in Pulido, the Court held that a judicial declaration of absolute nullity is not necessary to prove a prior or subsequent void ab initio marriage in a bigamy case. Thus, JR has a valid defense in the bigamy case."

In 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire family had to spend 24 hours together every day in their small house. Razna observed that although Junsi continued to work from home to support the family, he began to exhibit paranoia, and constantly kept making sure that they always washed their hands and rubbed them with alcohol 10 times before eating. Junsi also always wore a face mask, face shield and hazmat in the house, except when he was alone in the room. Junsi began sleeping separately from Razna and their children. He believed that other people who wanted to meet him in person were actively trying to harm him by exposing him to the virus. In early 2022, Razna filed a petition for declaration of nullity of her marriage with Junsi on the ground of psychological incapacity under Art. 36 of the Family Code, citing his atypical behavior. She presented the testimony of a doctor, who proved that Junsi was suffering from psychotic paranoia due to intense stress, which accounted for his belief in things that are not real. Should Razna's petition be granted? Explain briefly.",
        "Answer": "NO, Razna's petition should not be granted. Psychological incapacity has been ruled to be a legal concept and not a medical concept. (Tan-Andal v. Andal, G.R. No. 196359, 11 May 2021) Here, the fact that Junsi was suffering from psychotic paranoia does not make him automatically unable to comply with essential marital obligations. Based on the facts, despite his atypical behavior, he still continues to work and support his family. To be considered a ground to declare the marriage void, the psychological incapacity must be shown to be a durable or enduring aspect of a person's personality, called 'personality structure,' which manifests itself through clear acts of dysfunctionality that undermines the family. The spouse's personality structure must make it impossible for him or her to understand and, more important, to comply with his or her essential marital obligations. The supposed behavior of Jusni was stress-induced and does not form part of his personality structure. Thus, based on the standards in Tan-Andal, Jusni is not psychologically incapacitated."

        "Question": "Kardo met Glenda as a young lieutenant and after a whirlwind courtship, they were married. In the early part of his military career, Kardo was assigned to different places all over the country, but Glenda refused to accompany him as she preferred to live in her hometown. They did not live together until the 12th year of their marriage when Kardo had risen up the ranks and was given his own command. They moved to living quarters in Fort Gregorio. One day, while Kardo was away on official business, one of his military aides caught Glenda having sex with the corporal assigned as Kardo's driver. The aide immediately reported the matter to Kardo who rushed home to confront his wife. Glenda readily admitted the affair and Kardo sent her away in anger. Kardo would later come to know the true extent of Glenda's unfaithfulness from his aides, his household staff, and former neighbors who informed him that Glenda has had intimate relations with various men throughout their marriage whenever Kardo was away on assignment. Kardo filed a petition for declaration of nullity of marriage under Art. 36, FC. Based on interviews from Kardo, his aide, and the housekeeper, a psychologist testified that Glenda's habitual infidelity was due to her affliction with Histrionic Personality Disorder, an illness characterized by excessive emotionalism and uncontrollable attention-seeking behavior rooted in Glenda's abandonment as a child by her father. Kardo himself, his aide, and his housekeeper also testified in court. The RTC granted the petition, relying on the liberality espoused by Te v. Te and Azcueta v. Republic. However, the OSG filed an appeal, arguing that sexual infidelity was only a ground for legal separation and that the RTC failed to abide by the guidelines laid down in the Molina case. How would you decide the appeal?",
        "Answer": "I would dismiss the appeal. In the landmark case of Tan Andal v. Andal, the Court categorically abandoned the second Molina guideline. Psychological incapacity is neither a mental incapacity nor a personality disorder that must be proven through expert opinion. Ordinary witnesses who have been present in the life of the spouses before the latter contracted marriage may testify on behaviors that they have consistently observed from the supposedly incapacitated spouse."

        "Question": "You are a Family Court judge and before you is a Petition for the Declaration of Nullity of Marriage (under Art. 36, FC) filed by Maria against Neil. Maria claims that Neil is psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential obligations of marriage because Neil is a drunkard, a womanizer, a gambler, and a mama's boy—traits that she never knew or saw when Neil was courting her. Although summoned, Neil did not answer Maria's petition and never appeared in court. To support her petition, Maria presented three witnesses—herself, Dr. Elsie Chan, and Ambrosia. Dr. Chan testified on the psychological report on Neil that she prepared. Since Neil never acknowledged nor responded to her invitation for interviews, her report is solely based on her interviews with Maria and the spouses' minor children. Dr. Chan concluded that Neil is suffering from Narcissistic Personality Disorder, an ailment that she found to be already present since Neil's early adulthood and one that is grave and incurable. Maria testified on the specific instances when she found Neil drunk, with another woman, or squandering the family's resources in a casino. Ambrosia, the spouses' current household help, corroborated Maria's testimony. On the basis of the evidence presented, will you grant the petition?",
        "Answer": "YES, I will grant the petition. In the case of Tan-Andal v. Andal, the Court unanimously modified the interpretation of the requirements of psychological incapacity as a ground for declaration of nullity of marriage found in Art. 36, FC. With respect to gravity, the requirement is retained, not in the sense that psychological incapacity must be shown to be a serious or dangerous illness, but that 'mild characterological peculiarities, mood changes, occasional emotional outbursts' are excluded. The psychological incapacity cannot be mere 'refusal, neglect, or difficulty, much less ill will.' In other words, it must be shown that the incapacity is caused by a genuinely serious psychic cause. With respect to juridical antecedence, difficult to prove as it may be, it is still required to be proven as it is an explicit requirement of the law. Art. 36, FC is clear that the psychological incapacity must be existing 'at the time of the celebration' of the marriage,' even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization. This distinguishes psychological incapacity from divorce. With respect to incurability, it is not in the medical, but in the legal sense; hence, the third Molina guideline is amended accordingly, which means that the incapacity is so enduring and persistent with respect to a specific partner and contemplates a situation where the couple's respective personality structures are so incompatible and antagonistic that the only result of the union would be the inevitable and irreparable breakdown of the marriage."

        "Question": "Miko and Dinah started to live together as husband and wife without the benefit of marriage in 1984. 10 years after, they separated. In 1996, they decided to live together again, and in 1998, they got married. On 17 Feb. 2001, Dinah filed a complaint for declaration of nullity of her marriage with Miko on the ground of psychological incapacity under Art. 36, FC. The court rendered the following decision: 1. 'Declaring the marriage null and void; 2. Dissolving the regime of absolute community of property; and 3. Declaring that a decree of absolute nullity of marriage shall only be issued after liquidation, partition and distribution of the parties' properties under Art. 147, FC. Dinah filed a motion for partial reconsideration questioning the portion of the decision on the issuance of a decree of nullity of marriage only after the liquidation, partition and distribution of properties under Art. 147, FC. If you are the judge, how will you decide petitioner's motion for partial reconsideration? Why?",
        "Answer": "I will grant partial reconsideration. If the marriage is declared void under Art. 36, FC the provisions of the Family Code on liquidation, partition, and distribution of the properties on absolute community or conjugal partnership will not apply but rather Art. 147 or 148, FC depending on the presence or absence of a legal impediment between them. In Diño v. Diño, the SC ruled that Art. 50, FC and Sec. 19 of the Rules on Declaration of Nullity apply only to marriages that are declared void ab initio or annulled by final judgment under Arts. 40 and 45, FC. In short, Art. 50, FC does not apply to marriages that are declared void ab initio under Art. 36, FC which should be declared void without waiting for the liquidation of the properties of the parties."

If there is no marriage settlement, the salary of a 'spouse' in an adulterous marriage belongs to the conjugal partnership of gains.",
        "Answer": "FALSE. In an adulterous relationship, the salary of a married partner belongs to the absolute community or conjugal partnership of such married partner with his or her lawful spouse. Under Art. 148, FC, the property relations between married partner and his/her paramour is governed by ordinary co-ownership where the partners become co-owners only when they contributed to the acquisition of the property. The paramour is deemed to have not contributed to the earning of the salary of the married partner."

        "Question": "Before they married in 2000, Nonoy and Daday signed a marriage settlement wherein they agreed that their property relations as husband and wife would be governed by the conjugal partnership of gains. While the marriage was subsisting, they acquired a parcel of land using conjugal funds. The Register of Deeds issued a transfer certificate of title over the said land in the name of 'Nonoy, married to Daday'. Nonoy sold the parcel of land to Barby without Daday's consent. Daday was not aware of the sale and did not sign the contract of sale. A year after Nonoy and Barby signed the contract of sale, Daday died. When the children of Nonoy and Daday learned about the sale to Barby, they questioned its validity since Daday had not consented to the sale. Nonoy's position is that Daday's consent was not required because the property was registered in his name. Is the sale to Barby valid? Explain briefly.",
        "Answer": "NO, the sale to Barby is not valid. There is a presumption that all properties acquired during the marriage belong to the conjugal partnership whether the acquisition appears to have been made, contracted, or registered in the name of only one of the spouses. (Art. 116, FC) The fact that a spouse is identified as the sole vendee in the deed, and registered owner in the certificate of title does not destroy the conjugal nature of the property as the registration is not conclusive evidence of the exclusive ownership of either the husband or the wife. Even if the property appears to be registered solely in the name of either spouse, it has the inherent character of conjugal property if it was acquired for valuable consideration during the marriage. (Cordova v. Ty, G.R. No. 246255, 03 Feb. 2021) As part of the conjugal property of Nonoy and Daday, any disposition or encumbrance thereof must be made with the consent of both spouses. Hence, when Nonoy sold the land to Barby without the consent of Daday, the disposition is void under Art. 124 of the FC."

        "Question": "Maria, wife of Pedro, withdrew P5 Million from their conjugal funds. With this money, she constructed a building on a lot which she inherited from her father. Is the building conjugal or paraphernal? Reasons.",
        "Answer": "IT DEPENDS. If the value of the building is more than the value of the land, the building is conjugal and the land becomes conjugal property under Art. 120, FC. This is a case of reverse accession, where the building is considered as the principal and the land, the accessory. If, on the other hand, the value of the land is more than the value of the building, then the ordinary rule of accession applies where the land is the principal and the building, the accessory. In such case, the land remains paraphernal property and the building becomes paraphernal property."

They agreed on a fair price of P2 Million. Ray sent Linda a letter confirming his intention to buy the property. Later, another couple, Bernie and Elena, offered a similar house at a lower price of P1.5 Million. But Ray insisted on buying the house of Biong and Linda for sentimental reasons. Ray prepared a deed of sale to be signed by the couple and a manager's check for P2 Million. After receiving the P2 Million, Biong signed the deed of sale. However, Linda was not able to sign it because she was abroad. On her return, she refused to sign the document saying she changed her mind. Linda filed suit for nullification of the deed of sale and for moral and exemplary damages against Ray. Will the suit proper?",
        "Answer": "YES, the suit for nullification of the deed of sale will prosper. Sale of community property requires written consent of both spouses. The failure or refusal of Linda to affix her signature on the deed of sale, coupled with her express declaration of opposing the sale negates any valid consent on her part. The consent of Biong by himself is insufficient to effect a valid sale of community property. (Art. 96, FC; Abalos v. Macatangay, G.R. No. 155043, 30 Sept. 2004) However, Linda will not be entitled to damages because Ray is not in any way in bad faith."

In 1992, they jointly acquired a residential house and lot, as well as a condominium unit in Makati. In 1995, they decided to change their property relations to the regime of complete separation of property. Mila consented, as she was then engaged in a lucrative business. The spouses then signed a private document dissolving their conjugal partnership and agreeing on a complete separation of property.

        "Question": "In 1973, Mauricio, a Filipino pensioner of the U.S. Government, contracted a bigamous marriage with Erlinda, despite the fact that his first wife, Carol, was still living. In 1975, Mauricio and Erlinda jointly bought a parcel of rice land, with the title being placed jointly in their names. Shortly thereafter, they purchased another property (a house and lot) which was placed in her name alone as the buyer. In 1981, Mauricio died, and Carol promptly filed an action against Erlinda to recover both the Riceland and the house and lot, claiming them to be conjugal property of the first marriage. Erlinda contends that she and the late Mauricio were co-owners of the Riceland; and with respect to the house and lot, she claims she is the exclusive owner. Assuming she fails to prove that she had actually used her own money in either purchase, how do you decide the case?",
        "Answer": "Under Art. 148, FC, which applies to bigamous marriages, only the properties through their actual joint contribution of money, property or industry shall be owned by them in common in proportion to their respective contributions. Moreover, if one of the parties is validly married to another, his share in the co-ownership shall accrue to the absolute community, conjugal partnership existing in such valid marriage. Thus, in this case, since Erlinda failed to prove that she used her own money to buy the Riceland and house and lot, she cannot claim to be the co-owner of the Riceland nor the exclusive owner of the house and lot. Such properties are Mauricio's. And since his share accrues to the conjugal partnership with Carol, Carol can validly claim such properties to the exclusion of Erlinda. (Art. 144, NCC)"

Prior to the marriage, they agreed in a marriage settlement that the regime of conjugal partnership of gains shall govern their property relations during marriage. Shortly after the marriage, their daughter, Shalimar, was born. Before they met and got married, Sancho purchased a parcel of land on installment, under a Contract of Sale, with the full purchase price payable in equal annual amortizations over a period of 10 years, with no down payment, and secured by a mortgage on the land. The full purchase price was PhP1 million, with interest at the rate of 6% per annum. After paying the 4th annual installment, Sancho and Sandy got married, and Sancho completed the payments in the subsequent years from his salary as an accountant. The previous payments were also paid out of his salary. During their marriage, Sandy also won PhP1 million in the lottery and used it to purchase jewelry. When things didn't work out for the couple, they filed an action for declaration of nullity of their marriage based on the psychological incapacity of both of them.

In the Contracts to Sell, Jambrich and Descallar were referred to as the buyers. When the Deed of Absolute Sale was presented for registration before the Register of Deeds, it was refused because Jambrich was an alien and could not acquire alienable lands of the public domain. After Jambrich and Descallar separated, Jambrich purchased an engine and some accessories for his boat from Borromeo. To pay for his debt, he sold his rights and interests in the Agro-Macro properties to Borromeo. Borromeo discovered that titles to the 3 lots have been transferred in the name of Descallar. Who is the rightful owner of the properties? Explain.",
        "Answer": "It depends. On the assumption that the FC is the applicable law, the ownership of the properties depends on whether or not Jambrich and Descallar are capacitated to marry each other during their cohabitation, and whether or not both have contributed funds for the acquisition of the properties. If both of them were capacitated to marry each other, Art. 147 of the FC will apply to their property relations and the properties in question are owned by them in equal shares even though all the funds used in acquiring the properties came only from the salaries or wages or the income of Jambrich from his business or profession. In such a case, while Jambrich is disqualified to own any part of the properties, his subsequent transfer of all his interest therein to Borromeo, a Filipino, was valid as it removed the disqualification. In such case, the properties are owned by Borromeo and Descallar in equal shares. If, on the other hand, Jambrich and Descallar were not capacitated to marry each other, Art. 153, FC governs their property relations. Under this regime, Jambrich and Descallar are owners of the properties but only if both of them contributed in their acquisition. If all the funds used in acquiring the properties in question came from Jambrich, the entire property is his even though he is disqualified from owning it. His subsequent transfer to Borromeo, however, is valid as it removed the disqualification. In such case, all of the properties are owned by Borromeo. If, on the other hand, Descallar contributed to their acquisition, the properties are co-owned by Descallar and Borromeo in proportion to the respective contributions of Descallar and Jambrich."

An apartment unit donated to B by an uncle on 19 June 1987. Who owns the foregoing properties? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Since the marriage was declared void ab initio in 2001, no absolute community or conjugal partnership was ever established between B and G. Their property relation is governed by a 'special co-ownership' under Art. 147, FC because they were capacitated to marry each other. Under Art. 147, FC wages and salaries of the 'former spouses' earned during their cohabitation shall be owned by them in equal shares while properties acquired thru their work for industry shall be owned by them in proportion to their respective contributions. Care and maintenance of the family is recognized as a valuable contribution. In the absence of proof as to the value of their respective contributions, they shall share equally. If ownership of the house and lot was acquired by B on 03 Aug. 1988 at the time he bought it on installment before he got married, he shall remain owner of the house and lot but he must reimburse G for all the amounts she advanced to pay the purchase price and for one-half share in the last payment from their joint income. In such case, the house and lot were not acquired during their cohabitation, hence, are not co-owned by B and G. But if the ownership of the house and lot was acquired during the cohabitation, the house and lot will be owned as follows: i. 1/3 of the house and lot is owned by B. He is an undivided co-owner to that extent for his contributions in its acquisition in the form of the down payment he made before the celebration of the marriage. The money he used to pay the down payment was not earned during the cohabitation, hence, it is his exclusive property. ii. 1/3 of the house and lot is owned by G. She is an undivided co-owner to the extent for her contribution in its acquisition when she paid 1/3 of the purchase price using the gift from her parents. Although the gift was acquired by G during her cohabitation with B, it is her exclusive property. It did not consist of wage or salary or fruit of her work or industry. iii. 1/3 of the house is co-owned by B and G because the payment came from their co-owned funds, i.e., their joint income during their cohabitation which is shared by them equally in the absence of any proof to the contrary. After summing up their prospective shares, B and G are undivided co-owners of the house and lot in equal shares. As to the apartment, it is owned exclusive by B because he acquired it before their cohabitation. Even if he acquired it during their cohabitation, it will still be his exclusive property because it did not come from his wage or salary, or from his work or industry.

A house and lot acquired by B on 03 Aug. 1988, 1/3 of the purchase price (representing down payment) of which he paid; 1/3 was paid by G on 14 Feb. 1990 out of a cash gift given to her by her parents on her graduation on 06 Apr. 1989; and the balance was paid out of the spouses' joint income; and 2. An apartment unit donated to B by an uncle on 19 June 1987. If G and B had married on 03 July 1987 and their marriage was dissolved in 2007, who owns the properties? Explain.",
        "Answer": "The answer is the same as in letter A. Since the parties to the marriage which was later declared void ab initio were capacitated to marry each other, the applicable law under the NCC was Art. 144. This Article is substantially the same as Art. 147, FC. Hence, the determination of ownership will remain the same as in question A. And even assuming that the two provisions are not the same, Art. 147, FC is still the law that will govern the property relations of B and G because under Art. 256, the FC has retroactive effect insofar as it does not prejudice or impair vested or acquired rights under the NCC or other laws. Applying Art. 147, FC retroactively to the case of G and B will not impair any vested right. Until the declaration of nullity of the marriage under the FC, B and G have not yet acquired any vested right over the properties acquired during their cohabitation."

        "Question": "In 1997, B and G started living together without the benefit of marriage. The relationship produced one offspring, Venus. The couple acquired a residential lot in Parañaque. After four (4) years or in 2001, G having completed her 4-year college degree as a full-time student, she and B contracted marriage without a license. The marriage of B and G was, two years later, declared null and void due to the absence of a marriage license. If you were the judge who declared the nullity of the marriage, to whom would you award the lot? Explain briefly.",
        "Answer": "Since the marriage was null and void, no Absolute Community or Conjugal Partnership was established between B and G. Their properties are governed by the 'special co-ownership' provision of Art. 147, FC because both B and G were capacitated to marry each other. The said Article provides that when a man and a woman who are capacitated to marry each other, live exclusively with each other as husband and wife without the benefit of marriage, or under a void marriage: (1) their wages and salaries shall be owned by them in equal shares; and (2) property acquired by both of them through their work or industry shall be governed by the rules on co-ownership. In co-ownership, the parties are co-owners if they contributed something of value in the acquisition of the property. Their share is in proportion to their respective contributions. In an ordinary co-ownership the care and maintenance of the family is not recognized as a valuable contribution for the acquisition of a property. In the Art. 147 'special co-ownership', however, care and maintenance is recognized as a valuable contribution which will entitle the contributor to half of the property acquired. Having been acquired during their cohabitation, the residential lot is presumed acquired through their joint work and industry under Art. 147, hence B and G are co-owners of the said property in equal shares. Art. 147 also provides that when a party to the void marriage was in bad faith, he forfeits his share in the co-ownership in favor of the common children or descendants. In default of children or descendants, the forfeited share shall belong to the innocent party. In the foregoing problem, there is no showing that one party was in bad faith. Hence, both shall be presumed in good faith and no forfeiture shall take place."

The Mayor was not there, but the Mayor's secretary asked Michael and Anna and their witnesses to fill up and sign the required marriage contract forms. The secretary then told them to wait and went out to look for the Mayor who was attending a wedding in a neighboring municipality. When the secretary caught up with the Mayor at the wedding reception, she showed him the marriage contract forms and told him that the couple and their witnesses were waiting in his office. The Mayor forthwith signed all the copies of the marriage contract, gave them to the secretary who returned to the Mayor's office. She then gave copies of the marriage contract to the parties and told Michael and Anna that they were already married. Thereafter, the couple lived together as husband and wife, and had three sons. What governs the properties acquired by the couple? Explain.",

Rizza is not employed, stays at home, and takes charge of the household. After living together for a little over twenty years, Luis was able to save from his salary earnings during that period the amount of P200,000.00 presently deposited in a bank. A house and lot worth P500,000.00 used by the common-law spouses to purchase the property, P200,000.00 had come from the sale of palay harvested from the hacienda owned by Luis and P300,000.00 from the rentals of a building belonging to Rizza. In fine, the sum of P500,000.00 had been part of the fruits received during the period of cohabitation from their separate property. A car worth P100,000.00, being used by the common-law spouses, was donated just months ago to Rizza by her parents. Luis and Rizza now decide to terminate their cohabitation, and they ask you to give them your legal advice on the following: How, under the law, should the bank deposit of P200,000.00, the house and lot valued at P500,000.00 and the car worth P100,000.00 be allocated to them?",
        "Answer": "Art. 147, FC provides in part that when a man and a woman who are capacitated to marry each other, live exclusively with each other as husband and wife without the benefit of marriage or under a void marriage, their wages and salaries shall be owned by them through their work or industry shall be governed by the rules of co-ownership. In the absence of proof to the contrary, properties acquired while they lived together shall be presumed to have been obtained by their joint efforts, work or industry, and shall be owned by them in equal shares. A party who did not participate in the acquisition by the other party of any property shall be deemed to have contributed jointly in the acquisition thereof if the former's efforts consisted in the care and maintenance of the family and of the household.

In the absence of the foregoing documents, an illegitimate child may also prove his or her filiation by open and continuous possession of the status of an illegitimate child or any other means allowed by the Rules of Court like entries in family bible or act or declaration about pedigree.

They were born during the marriage of Conrado and Clarita, hence, are considered legitimate children of the said spouses. This status is conferred on them at birth by law. Under Philippine law, a person cannot have more than one natural filiation. The legitimate filiation of a person can be changed only if the legitimate father will successfully impugn such status. In the problem, therefore, the filiation of Alberto and Baldomero as the legitimate children of Conrado cannot be changed by their recognition by Edilberto as his illegitimate children. Before they can be conferred the status of Edilberto's illegitimate children, Conrado must first impugn their legitimacy. Since Conrado has not initiated any action to impugn their legitimacy, they continue to be the legitimate children of Conrado. They cannot be the illegitimate children of Edilberto at the same time. Not being the illegitimate children of Edilberto, they have no right to inherit from him."

        "Answer": "Under the facts stated, X and Y are legitimate children of B and G. E is the legitimate children of B and G. E is the legitimated child of B and G. F is the illegitimate child of B and C as legitimate children of B and C, X and Y have the following rights: 1) To bear the surnames of the father and the mother, in conformity with the provisions of the NCC on surnames; 2) To receive support from their parents, their ascendants, and in proper cases, their brothers and sisters, in conformity with the provisions of the FC on Support; and To be entitled to the legitime and other successional rights granted to them by the NCC. (Art. 174, FC) E is the legitimated child of B and G. Under Art. 177, FC, only children conceived and born outside of wedlock of parents who, at the time of the conception of the former, were not disqualified by any impediment to marry each other may be legitimated. E will have the same rights as X and Y. F is the illegitimate child of B and G. F has the right to use the surname of G, her mother, and is entitled to support as well as the legitime consisting of 1/2 of that of each of X, Y, and E. (Art. 176, FC)"

        "Question": "After finding out that his girlfriend Sandy was 4 months pregnant, Sancho married Sandy. Both were single and had never been in any serious relationship in the past. Prior to the marriage, they agreed in a marriage settlement that the regime of conjugal partnership of gains shall govern their property relations during marriage. Shortly after the marriage, their daughter, Shalimar, was born. Before they met and got married, Sancho purchased a parcel of land on installment, under a Contract of Sale, with the full purchase price payable in equal annual amortizations over a period of 10 years, with no down payment, and secured by a mortgage on the land. The full purchase price was PhP 1million, with interest at the rate of 6% per annum. After paying the fourth annual installment, Sancho and Sandy got married, and Sancho completed the payments in the subsequent years from his salary as an accountant. The previous payments were also paid out of his salary. During their marriage, Sandy also won PhP1million in the lottery and used it to purchase jewelry. When things didn't work out for the couple, they filed an action for declaration of nullity of their marriage based on the psychological incapacity of both of them. When the petition was granted, the parcel of land and the jewelry bought by Sandy were found to be the only properties of the couple. What is the filiation status of Shalimar?",
        "Answer": "Shalimar is a legitimate child. Children conceived or born before the judgment of absolute nullity of the marriage because of psychological incapacity under Art. 36 has become final and executory shall be considered legitimate. (Art. 54, FC) Since Shalimar was born before the judgment granting the petition for declaration of absolute nullity of marriage of Sancho and Sandy under Art. 36 became final and executory. Shalimar is a legitimate child."

        "Question": "In 1990, Monica was born during the marriage of her parents Anton and Steph. In 2024, Monica discovered that a certain Patrick signed as the father in her birth certificate. Monica looked for Patrick and was informed that he passed away a year earlier. Monica learned that Patrick was Steph's last boyfriend before she married Anton. Thereafter, Monica filed a complaint for partition of Patrick's estate. Monica claimed that she is the non-marital child of Patrick and Steph. Monica submitted her birth certificate where Patrick recognized her as his daughter. The heirs of Patrick opposed the complaint and argued that Monica is presumed the legitimate child of Anton and Steph pursuant to Article 164 of the Family Code which states that 'children conceived or born during the marriage of the parents are legitimate.' The heirs of Patrick also invoked the rule that only the father can impugn the legitimacy of the child. May Monica impugn her own legitimacy in an action for partition? Explain.",
        "Answer": "NO. Monica cannot impugn her own legitimacy in an action for partition. Legitimacy cannot be attacked collaterally but only in a direct action filed for that purpose. (Liyao v. Liyao, G.R. No. 138961, March 7, 2002; De Jesus v. Estate of Dizon, G.R. No. 142877, October 2, 2001) The law provides that only the husband, and in exceptional cases his heirs, can impugn the legitimacy of the child born to the wife. (Article 171, Family Code) Moreover, the law mandates that the action to impugn legitimacy shall be brought within one year from knowledge of birth or its recording in the civil register if the husband resides in the same city or municipality where the birth took place or was recorded, two years if he resides in a different city or municipality, and three years if he resides abroad. Based on the law, Monica is not the proper party to impugn her legitimacy and even if she were, the action filed after twenty-four years has clearly prescribed. (See Also - Santiago v. Jornacion, G.R. No. 230049, October 6, 2021; Yap v. Yap, G.R. No. 222259, October 17, 2022)"

While Andy was single at the time, Aimee was still in the process of securing a judicial declaration of nullity on her marriage to her ex-husband. Gianna's birth certificate, which was signed by both Andy and Aimee, registered the status of Gianna as 'legitimate,' her surname carrying that of Andy's and that her parents were married to each other. Assuming that Aimee is successful in declaring her former marriage void, and Andy and Aimee subsequently married each other, would Gianna be legitimated?",
        "Answer": "NO, Gianna will not be legitimated. While the court may have declared the marriage void ab initio and therefore, no marriage took place in the eyes of the law, Gianna will still not be legitimated. This is because at the time she was conceived and born her biological parents could not have validly married each other. For their marriage to be valid, the court must first declare the first marriage null and void. In the problem, Gianna was conceived and born before the court has decreed the nullity of her mother's previous marriage."

Under the Domestic Administrative Adoption and Alternative Child Care Act (R.A. No. 11642), the following are necessary to give their consent to the adoption: 1. the adoptee, if 10 years of age or over; 2. the biological parents of the child, if known, or the legal guardian, or the proper government instrumentality which has legal custody of the child, except in the case of a Filipino of legal age if, prior to the adoption, said person has been consistently considered and treated as their own child by the adopters for at least 3 years; 3. The legitimate and adopted children, 10 years of age or over, of the adopters, if any; 4. The illegitimate children, 10 years of age or over, of the adopter if living with said adopter or over whom the adopter exercises parental authority and the latter's spouse, if any; and (5) The spouse, if any, of the person adopting or to be adopted. (Sec. 23, R.A. 11642) Since Rex and Lea are legally separated, her consent is no longer necessary. Therefore, only the consent of the 14-year-old legitimate child, the 10-year-old illegitimate child and of the biological parents or legal guardian of the illegitimate child are needed for the adoption."

        "Answer": "IT DEPENDS. If Tom and Sarah have been residing in the Philippines for at least 3 years prior to the effectivity of R.A. No. 8552, the petition may be granted because the American husband is not qualified to adopt. While the petition for adoption was filed in 1990, it was considered refiled upon the effectivity of R.A. No. 8552, the Domestic Adoption Act of 1998. This is the law applicable, the petition being still pending with the lower court. Under the Act, Sarah and Tom must adopt jointly because they do not fall in any of the exceptions where one of them may adopt alone. When husband and wife must adopt jointly, the Supreme Court has held in a line of cases that both of them must be qualified to adopt. While Sarah, an alien, is qualified to adopt under Sec. 7(b)(1) of the Act for being a former Filipino citizen who seeks to adopt a relative within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity, Tom an alien, is not qualified because he is neither a former Filipino citizen, nor married to a Filipino. One of them not being qualified to adopt their petition has to be denied. However, if they have been residents of the Philippines three years prior to the effectivity of the Act and continues to reside here until the decree of adoption is entered, they are qualified to adopt the nephew of Sara under Sec. 7(b) thereof, and the petition may be granted."

        "Answer": "YES, the trial court was correct. At the time the positions for adoptions were filed, petitioner had already remarried.

At that time, their child, Amado, was only 18 months old. Lila and Christopher returned to the Philippines and settled in El Nido, Palawan. Christopher allegedly promised to give support to Amado in the amount of US$1,000 per month, but he never did. Subsequently, Christopher also settled in Cebu where he cohabited with another Filipino woman. When Lila learned of the whereabouts of Christopher, she filed a complaint against him for violation of the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act for his refusal to support Amado. Lila also invoked Article 195 of the Family Code, which provides for those who are obliged to support each other. She argued that notwithstanding their divorce, Christopher is not excused from complying with his obligation to support Amado. Is Lila correct in invoking Article 195 of the Family Code? Explain.",
        "Answer": "NO, Lila is not correct in invoking Art. 195 of the Family Code. While it is true that under Art. 195 of the Family Code, the father is obliged to support his legitimate and illegitimate children, the defendant here is a foreign citizen and he shall be governed by his own national law. The nationality principle under Art. 15 of the Civil Code in relation to the Family Code provisions on support applies only to Filipino citizens. By analogy, the same principle applies to foreigners in that they are governed by their national law with respect to their family rights and duties. In the case presented, Christopher being an American citizen shall be governed by his national law. Thus, as to whether he is obliged to give support to his child as well as the consequences of his failure to do so shall be governed by American law. However, if Christopher invokes his national law he has the burden of proving the same and if the foreign law involved is not properly pleaded and proved, our courts will presume that the foreign law is the same as our local or domestic or internal law which enforces the obligation of parents to support their children and penalizing the non-compliance therewith.

While Sofia stayed in the Philippines with the children, Semuel went abroad to work and became a naturalized German citizen. He met someone in Germany whom he wanted to marry. Semuel thereafter came home and filed a petition with the RTC for partition of the common properties acquired during his union with Sofia in the Philippines. The properties acquired during the union consisted of a house and lot in Cavite worth P2 million, and some personal properties, including cash in bank amounting to P1 million. All these properties were acquired using Semuel's salaries and wages since Sofia was a stay-at-home mother. In retaliation, Sofia filed an action, on behalf of their minor children, for support. Should Semuel be required to support the minor children?",
        "Answer": "YES, Semuel is required to support his three children even if they were all born outside of wedlock. Support is ordained not only between parents and their legitimate children and the legitimate and illegitimate children of the latter, but also between parents and their illegitimate children and the legitimate and illegitimate children of the latter. (Art. 195, FC) The support that Semuel has to provide comprises everything indispensable for sustenance, dwelling, clothing, medical attendance, education and transportation including the children's schooling or training for some profession, trade or vocation. (Art. 194, FC) Even if Semuel is already a German citizen and on the assumption that German law does not require the natural father to support his illegitimate children, his denial of financial support is considered a criminal offense under Philippine law (R.A. No. 9262). Since he currently in the Philippines, the territoriality principle in criminal law will apply to render him liable for violation of our law on violence against women and children.

Basha countered that she is able to take care of and provide for Kynan despite her meager income. Are there compelling reasons to deprive Basha of Kynan's custody? Explain.",
        "Answer": "There are no compelling reasons to deprive Basha of Kynan's custody. Kynan was born outside of wedlock and therefore he is illegitimate. Article 176 of the Family Code an illegitimate child shall be under the sole parental authority and custody of the mother. (Briones v. Miguel G.R. No. 156343; October 18, 2004) Moreover, Popoy's contention that Basha is unfit to have custody of the child is without merit because only the most compelling of reasons shall justify the court's awarding the custody of such a child to someone other than his mother, such as her unfitness to exercise sole parental authority. The following grounds have been considered ample justifications to deprive a mother of custody and parental authority: neglect, abandonment, unemployment and immorality, habitual drunkenness, drug addiction, maltreatment of the child, insanity and being sick with a communicable disease. (Perez v. Court of Appeals G.R. No. 118870 March 29, 1996) Here, the supposed lesbian relationship of Basha would not constitute a compelling reason to deprive her of custody of her child. Assuming that such constitutes moral dereliction, it will not have any effect upon the baby who is as yet unable to understand her situation."

After spending the night together, Billy got Anita pregnant. A year after giving birth to Marisol and despite the vehement opposition of Billy, Anita went back to her previous job in Empyrea to support her child. Anita was able to provide a house, a nanny, and other necessities for Marisol. Billy, however, insisted that Anita no longer needed to work if she and Marisol stayed with him as he could provide for them. Since Anita refused to live with Billy, the latter filed a petition for custody of Marisol. Anita contended that illegitimate children are automatically under the sole custody and parental authority of the mother. On the other hand, Billy alleged that Anita is unfit to take care of Marisol given her line of work. If you are the judge, how will you decide the petition? Explain.",
        "Answer": "If I were the judge, I will rule in favor of Anita. The Family Code provides that illegitimate children shall be under the sole parental authority of the mother. (Art. 176, NCC) In addition, under the maternal preference rule, no child below seven years of age shall be separated from the mother unless there are compelling reasons to do so. In the case presented, Marisol is obviously an illegitimate child as she was born outside of wedlock to Anita and Billy. The child is also below seven years of age since the facts state that Anita went back to her job one year after giving birth to Marisol and it was at this time that Billy filed the custody petition. While even an illegitimate child may be separated from its mother if there is a compelling reason to do so, the instant case does not reveal that Anita is unfit to have custody of Marisol just because she works as an entertainer at a men's club. The Supreme Court in one case ruled that only the most compelling reasons shall justify the court's awarding of custody to someone other than the mother such as neglect, abandonment, unemployment, immorality, habitual drunkenness, and drug abuse.

        "Answer": "In substitute parental authority, the parents lose their parental authority in favor of the substitute who acquires it to the exclusion of the parents. In special parental authority, the parents or anyone exercising parental authority does not lose parental authority. Those who are charged with special parental authority exercise such authority only during the time that the child is in their custody or supervision. Substitute parental authority displaces parental authority while special parental authority concurs with parental authority."

        "Question": "On 05 May 1989, 16-year-old Rozanno, who was issued a student permit, drove to school a car, a gift from his parents. On even date, as his class was scheduled to go on a field trip, his teacher requested him to accommodate in his car, as he did, four (4) of his classmates because the van rented by the school was too crowded. On the way to a museum which the students were scheduled to visit, Rozanno made a wrong maneuver, causing a collision with a jeepney. One of his classmates died. He and the three (3) others were badly injured. Who is liable for the death of Rozanno's classmate, and the injuries suffered by Rozanno and his 3 other classmates? Explain.",
        "Answer": "At the time the incident occurred in May 1989, Rozanno was still a minor. Being a minor, Art. 218, (FC) applies. Pursuant to Art. 218, the school, its administrators and teachers shall be liable for the acts of minor Rozanno because of the special parental authority and responsibility that they exercise over him. The authority applies to all authorized activities, whether inside or outside the premises of the school, entity or institution. The field trip on which occasion Rozanno drove the car, was an authorized activity, and, thus, covered by the provision. Furthermore, the parents of Rozanno are subsidiarily liable pursuant to Art. 219 of the FC, and principally liable under Art. 221 of the FC, if they are negligent."

On the way to a museum which the students were scheduled to visit, Rozanno made a wrong maneuver, causing a collision with a jeepney. One of his classmates died. He and the three (3) others were badly injured. Under the same facts, except the date of occurrence of the incident, this time in mid-1994, what would be your answer? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Since Rozanno was 16 years old in 1989, if the incident happened sometime in the middle of 1994, Rozanno have been 21 years old at the time. Hence, he was already of legal age. The law reducing the age of majority to 18 years took effect in December 1989. Being of legal age, Arts. 218, 219, and 221, FC are no longer applicable. In such case, only Rozanno will be personally responsible for all the consequences of his act unless his school or his parents were themselves also negligent and such negligence contributed to the happening of the incident. In that event, the school or his parents are not liable under Arts. 218, 218, or 221, FC, but will be liable under general provision of the NCC on quasi-delict."

        "Question": "If during class hours, while the teacher was chatting with other teachers in the school corridor, a 7-year-old male pupil stabs the eye of another boy with a ball pen during a fight, causing permanent blindness to the victim, who could be liable for damages for the boy's injury: the teacher, the school authorities, or the guilty boy's parents? Explain.",
        "Answer": "The school, its administrators, and teachers have special parental authority and responsibility over the minor child while under their supervision, instruction or custody. (Art. 218, FC) They are principally and solidarity liable for the damages caused by the acts or omissions of the unemancipated minor unless they exercised the proper diligence required under the circumstances. (Art. 219, FC) In the problem, the teacher and the school authorities are liable for the blindness of the victim, because the student who causes it was under their special parental authority and they were negligent. They were negligent because they were chatting in the corridor during the class period when the stabbing incident occurred. The incident could have been prevented had the teacher been inside the classroom at that time. The guilty boy's PARENTS are subsidiarily liable under Art. 219, FC."

        "Question": "Gigolo entered into an agreement with Majorette for her to carry in her womb his baby via in vitro fertilization. Gigolo undertook to underwrite Majorette's pre-natal expenses as well as those attendant to her delivery. Gigolo would thereafter pay Majorette P2 million and, in return, she would give custody of the baby to him. After Majorette gives birth and delivers the baby to Gigolo following her receipt of P2 million, she engages your services as her lawyer to regain custody of the baby. What legal action can you file on behalf of Majorette? Explain.",
        "Answer": "As her lawyer, I can file a petition for habeas corpus on behalf Majorette to recover custody of her child. Since she is the mother of the child that was born out of wedlock, she has exclusive parental authority and custody over the child. Gigolo, therefore, has no right to have custody of the child and his refusal to give up custody will constitute illegal detention for which habeas corpus is the proper remedy."

Can Gigolo demand from Majorette the return of the P2 million if he returns the baby? Explain.",
        "Answer": "NO, he cannot. Both he and Majorette are guilty of violating the provision of the Anti-Child Abuse Law (R.A. No. 7610) on child trafficking. Being in part delicto, the parties shall be left where they are, and Gigolo cannot demand the return of what he paid."

        "Question": "Sara borrowed P50,000.00 from Julia and orally promised to pay it within six months. When Sara tried to pay her debt on the 8th month, Julia demanded the payment of interest of 12% per annum because of Sara's delay in payment. Sara paid her debt and the interest claimed by Julia. After rethinking, Sara demanded back from Julia the amount she had paid as interest. Julia claims she has no obligation to return the interest paid by Sara because it was a natural obligation which Sara voluntarily performed and can no longer recover. Do you agree? Explain.",
        "Answer": "NO. Under the Civil Code, natural obligations are those not based on positive law but on equity and natural law. (Art. 1423, NCC) The obligation in this case is based on positive law, particularly the provisions governing solutio indebiti or payment by mistake. (Art. 22, NCC) Applying the Civil Code, Sara has no demandable obligation to pay interest because no stipulation for the payment of such was made in writing. (Art. 1956, NCC) Thus, there was a payment by mistake made by Sara."
