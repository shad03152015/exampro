        "Question": "The doctrine of processual presumption allows the court of the forum to presume that the foreign law applicable to the case is the same as the local or domestic law. (TRUE or FALSE. Explain your answer in not more than two (2) sentences.)",
        "Answer": "True. Where a foreign law is not pleaded or even if pleaded, is not proved as a fact, the presumption is that foreign law is the same as domestic law."

        "Question": "A dead child can be legitimated. (TRUE or FALSE. Explain your answer in not more than two (2) sentences.)",
        "Answer": "True. The law provides that legitimation of children who died before the celebration of the marriage will benefit their descendants (Article 181, Family Code). It can be gleaned that the law does not require the child to still be alive at the time of the marriage of his/her parents before legitimation may take place."

        "Question": "Dr. Lopez, a 70-year old widower, and his son Roberto both died in a fire that gutted their home. Dr. Lopez left an estate worth P20M and a life insurance policy in the amount of P1M with his three children — one of whom is Roberto — as beneficiaries. Roberto’s wife, Marilyn, is claiming for herself and her children her husband’s share in the estate left by Dr. Lopez, and her husband's share in the proceeds of Dr. Lopez’s life insurance policy. Rule on the validity of Marilyn’s claims with reasons. ",
        "Answer": "As to Dr. Lopez' estate: Marilyn's claim is without merit because Dr. Lopez and Roberto are presumed to have died at the same time (Article 43, Civil Code), and there shall be no transmission of rights from one to the other. Roberto inherited nothing from his father which he could pass to his wife Marilyn; however, Roberto's children may inherit from Dr. Lopez by right of representation and shall receive 1/3 share of his estate. As to the proceeds of the insurance on the life of Dr. Lopez: Marilyn is entitled to a share because the presumptions on survivorship under the Rules of Court apply; Dr. Lopez (70 years old) is presumed to have died ahead of his younger son Roberto. Roberto's right as beneficiary became vested at the time of Dr. Lopez' death, becoming part of Roberto's estate, which passes on to his surviving heirs (Marilyn and his children)."

        "Question": "Michael and Anna, after obtaining a valid marriage license, had their marriage contract forms signed by the Mayor outside of their presence, without a ceremony. They lived together and had three sons. Is the marriage of Michael and Anna valid, voidable, or void? Explain your answer. ",
        "Answer": "The marriage is void. One of the formal requisites under the Family Code is a marriage ceremony, requiring the consent of the parties to be freely given in the presence of the solemnizing officer. In this case, there was no ceremony conducted, making the marriage void for total absence of a formal requisite."

Wilma and Joseph established permanent residence in the Philippines. Is the divorce obtained by Wilma from Harry recognized in the Philippines? Explain your answer. ",
        "Answer": "Yes, the divorce obtained by Wilma from Harry is recognized as valid in the Philippines, provided that the appropriate petition for recognition of the foreign judgment is filed. Wilma was already a naturalized citizen of a foreign country when she obtained the divorce decree in accordance with her national law; thus, the divorce is considered valid in the Philippines because the nationality principle applies only to Filipino citizens."

Wilma and Joseph established permanent residence in the Philippines. If Harry hires you as his lawyer regarding Wilma's divorce, what legal recourse would you advise him to take? Why? ",
        "Answer": "I will advise Harry to file a petition for the recognition of the foreign divorce decree obtained by Wilma. He may file a petition for declaratory relief and move therein that Wilma was no longer a Filipino citizen at the time she secured the divorce and present evidence as the law of the foreign country on divorce and jurisdiction of the court which issued the divorce. I will also advise him to liquidate their properties."

Should the claims of Alberto and Baldomero be sustained? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, the claims should not be sustained. Edilberto cannot impugn the legitimacy of Alberto and Baldomero as he is not the legal husband of Clarita. There being no filiation between Alberto and Baldomero as against Edilberto, they have no right to inherit from the latter (De Jesus v. Estate of Juan Dizon, G.R. No. 142877, 2 October 2001)."

New York laws do not recognize holographic wills. Can the holographic will of Dr. Fuentes be admitted to probate in the Philippines? Why or why not? ",
        "Answer": "Yes, the holographic will of Dr. Fuentes can be admitted to probate in the Philippines. The will of an alien abroad produces effect in the Philippines if it is executed in accordance with the formalities prescribed by the law in which he resides, or observed in his country, or in accordance with Philippine law, or the law of the place where the will was executed (Article 816, Article 17, Civil Code). Since Dr. Fuentes executed the holographic will in the Philippines, Philippine law shall apply, which recognizes its validity."

        "Question": "Dr. Juanito Fuentes executed a holographic will in the Philippines. He later became a naturalized American citizen residing in New York, where he died. New York laws do not recognize holographic wills. Assuming the will of Dr. Fuentes (American citizen who disinherited his illegitimate son, Jay) is probated in the Philippines, can Jay validly insist that he be given his legitime? Why or why not? ",
        "Answer": "No, Jay cannot validly insist on his legitime. The national law of the testator (New York law) determines the rightful heirs, their order of succession, and their shares, as well as capacity to succeed (Article 16, Article 1039, Civil Code). Since Dr. Fuentes was a citizen of New York at the time of his death, and New York law does not recognize compulsory heirs, Jay may not insist on his legitime."

        "Answer": "The wife shall receive one-half of the estate, while the siblings and nephew inherit the other half (Article 995 & 1001, Civil Code). Half-blood brothers receive one-half of what a full-blood brother gets. The division is: Ramon's wife: P5,000,000.00 (one-half); Three full-blood brothers: P1,000,000.00 each; Nephew (by representation of deceased full-blood brother): P1,000,000.00; Two half-brothers: P500,000.00 each."

The tenants refused, insisting they would only vacate when the lease expired. Is Ildefonso bound to respect the lease contracts between Jude and his tenants? Explain your answer. ",
        "Answer": "Yes, Ildefonso is bound to respect the lease contracts. Ildefonso, as the transferor’s assignee, merely steps into the shoes of Jude. His actual knowledge of the lease puts him on notice that the tenants have an existing contractual right, and thus, he cannot be considered an innocent purchaser for value. He is bound to respect the contract."

The original owners discovered this and hired a lawyer. What action or actions should be instituted? ",
        "Answer": "In view of the good faith of the buyer Luis, no action can be taken by the spouses Teodoro and Anita against him. Luis had the right to rely on what is written on the certificate of title, in the absence of any circumstance that would incite suspicion as to the defect in the title of the transferor."

        "Answer": "Yes, my answer will still be the same. The law states that in motor vehicle mishaps, the owner is solidarily liable with his driver if he was inside the vehicle and could have prevented the accident by the use of due diligence in supervising his driver (Article 2184). However, it is incumbent upon the victim to prove that the owner could have prevented the mishap but failed to do so."

        "Answer": "True. By dation in payment, property is alienated to the creditor in satisfaction of a debt in money (Article 1245, Civil Code). The renouncer is alienating his property to his co-owners in satisfaction of his money obligation (Article 488, Civil Code)."

        "Answer": "No, the suit will not prosper. The court should refuse jurisdiction on the ground of *forum non conveniens* because the parties are not citizens or domiciliaries of the Philippines, and the suit is for annulment which is not governed by Philippine law. Alternatively, assuming jurisdiction is taken, the suit will still not prosper because being American nationals, the dissolution of their marriage is governed by their national law, not the law of Kenya, and sterility is not a ground for annulment under Philippine law (the law of the forum, in absence of proof of US law)."

        "Question": "Assume Emmanuel and Margarita are both Filipinos. After their wedding in Kenya, they return to the Philippines. Can their marriage be annulled on the ground of Emmanuel's sterility? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "No, the marriage cannot be annulled because Philippine law does not provide sterility as one of the grounds for annulment of marriage (Article 45, Family Code). While the formal validity is governed by the law of Kenya, the incidents of marriage and its termination or dissolution are governed by Philippine law."

In this situation, the court may grant the petition despite Rafael's demise, otherwise, the proceedings should be dismissed (Section 13, Republic Act 8552)."

Will your answer to the prior question be the same If it was Dolly (the adoptee) who died during the pendency of the adoption proceedings? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "No, the answer will be different. If it is the adoptee who dies during the pendency of the proceedings, the petition should be dismissed. Death of the prospective adoptee terminates the proceedings as adoption is for the best interest of the adoptee, and this purpose would no longer exist if the latter dies."

        "Answer": "No, Rodolfo cannot compel Rona to use his surname. The law provides that the illegitimate child shall use the surname of the mother, but the child *may* use the surname of the father when the latter has recognized him (Republic Act No. 9255). Since the choice belongs to the child, Rodolfo cannot compel Rona to use his surname."

When Rona (illegitimate child) reaches seven (7) years old, she tells Rodolfo (her father) that she prefers to live with him because he is better off financially than Nanette (her mother). If Rodolfo files an action for the custody of Rona, alleging Rona’s choice, will the court grant Rodolfo’s petition? Why or why not? ",
        "Answer": "No, the court should not grant the petition. Article 176 of the Family Code gives sole parental authority of an illegitimate child to the mother. The father’s recognition of his illegitimate child is a ground to order support but not to award him custody (Briones v. Miguel, G.R. No. 156343 October 18, 2004). Absent any compelling reasons proving Nanette is unfit, Rodolfo's petition must be denied."

        "Question": "Sarah obtained a P1.2M loan from Filipino Universal Bank, secured by checks for 12 monthly installments. Checks for the 3rd, 4th, and 5th months bounced. The bank declared the whole obligation due and deducted P1M from Sarah's P5M deposit via compensation. Is the bank correct? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "No, the bank is not correct. Both obligations are due, demandable, and liquidated only up to the extent of P300,000.00 (covering the unpaid 3rd, 4th, and 5th monthly installments). Since the facts do not state that the contract contains an acceleration clause, the bank should not have considered the full balance due and demandable. At most, the bank can only deduct P300,000.00 from Sarah's deposit by way of compensation."

Marciano ordered demolition, claiming the alluvium belongs to him as the registered riparian owner and that his right is enforceable against the whole world. Is Marciano correct? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Yes, Marciano is correct. The law states that accretion belongs to the owners of the lands adjoining the banks of the rivers (Article 457, Civil Code), and this right is enforceable against the whole world. While the additional area does not automatically become part of his titled property, Ulpiano cannot acquire it by prescription because his possession was not in the concept of an owner but merely as a holder (farmworker). Only possession in the concept of an owner can serve as a title for acquiring dominion (Article 540, Civil Code)."

Marciano ordered demolition, claiming the alluvium belongs to him as the registered riparian owner and that his right is enforceable against the whole world. What rights, if any, does Ulpiano have against Marciano regarding the reclaimed property? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Ulpiano, even as a possessor in bad faith, is entitled to reimbursement for the taxes he has paid based on quasi-contract, as these charges are properly for the owner's account. Ulpiano also has the right to recover the necessary expenses for the preservation of the land (Article 546, Civil Code)."

        "Answer": "Yes, the contract is valid. The prohibition on *pactum commissorium* (Article 2088, Civil Code) prohibits the creditor from *automatically* appropriating the thing pledged. In this situation, there is no automatic appropriation because Rosario still has to execute a document first in favor of Jennifer before appropriation can occur."

Will your answer to the prior question be the same if the contract stipulates that upon failure of Rosario to redeem the ring on due date, Jennifer may immediately sell the ring and appropriate the entire proceeds thereof for herself as full payment of the loan? Reasons. ",
        "Answer": "No, my answer will be different. Automatic appropriation is prohibited by law. If Jennifer is permitted to immediately sell the ring and appropriate the proceeds without the formality of public auction, it is tantamount to automatic appropriation, which is violative of the provision on *pactum commissorium* and is therefore void."

These conditions are: 1) The damage or destruction has rendered one-half or more of the units untenantable; AND 2) condominium owners holding in aggregate more than thirty percent interest in the common areas are opposed to repair or restoration of the project."

In 2007, Luciano sued to recover the land, alleging the 1972 sale to an alien was void. Decide the case with reasons. ",
        "Answer": "The suit must be dismissed. While the sale of private land to an alien is generally prohibited by the Constitution, the flaw in the original transaction is considered cured when the property is subsequently transferred to a citizen (Julian). The title of the transferee (Julian) is thus rendered valid (United Church Board of World Ministries v. Sebastian)."

It is not enough that the Filipino spouse proves that the alien spouse has obtained a divorce against him, he must also show that the divorce decree capacitates the alien spouse to remarry (Article 26, Family Code).

Who should the lessees sue for damages? 1) A, the owner 2) B, the engineer 3) both A & B ",
        "Answer": "No. 3 - Both A and B. Under the law, the lessee may proceed against A for breach of contract because the latter, as lessor, is obliged to make all necessary repairs on the property leased (Article 1654, Civil Code) and as the proprietor of the building, A shall also be responsible for the damages resulting from its total or paitial collapse if it is due to lack of necessary repairs (Article 2190, Civil Code). The lessees may also proceed against B for tort liability. The law states that engineer or architect who drew up the plans and specifications for a building is liable for damages if within fifteen (15) years from the completion of the structure, the same should collapse by reason of a defect in those plans and specifications or due to the defects in the ground (Article 1723, Article 2192, Civil Code)."

        "Answer": "No. 4 - **None of the above**. In general, the treasure belongs to the owner of the land where it is found. The exception requires that the treasure must be found **by chance** (Article 438, Civil Code). O, as finder, is not entitled to a share because she was aware that the treasure was buried in Lot B.

Option 3 (B can accept the donation anytime convenient to him) is false because the donee must accept the donation **during the lifetime of the donor** (Article 746, Civil Code).

What is the effect of B being a witness to the will? 1) The will is invalidated 2) The will is valid and effective 3) The legacy given to B's child is not valid ",
        "Answer": "No. 3 - **The legacy given to B's child is invalid**. Under the law, the validity of the will is not affected by the legacy given in favor of the son of an attesting witness. However, the said legacy is **void** (Article 823, Civil Code) because an attesting witness or his spouse, parent, or child is disqualified to become a legatee or devisee, owing to the possible undue influence the witness may exercise upon the testator. This rule is excepted if there are more than three witnesses and one of them was instituted as a legatee or devisee."

Comity theory relies on the courtesy, respect, or friendship extended by one jurisdiction to enforce the laws of another jurisdiction (legal reciprocity). Statute theory relies on the existence of a **domestic law** which confers upon the local courts the power to assume jurisdiction."

Support is ordained between the husband and the wife during the **subsistence of their marriage**, and children are likewise entitled to support from both parents. Since the compromise agreement regarding property dissolution occurred while the nullity case was pending, the marriage has not yet been dissolved, and therefore, G is still entitled to support from B."

At the time of the dissolution of the marriage, the couple possessed the following properties: A house and lot acquired by B on August 3, 1988, one third (1/3) of the purchase price (representing down payment) of which he paid; one third (1/3) was paid by G on February 14, 1990 out of a cash gift given to her by her parents on her graduation on April 6, 1989; and the balance was paid out of the spouses' joint income; and an apartment unit donated to B by an uncle on June 19, 1987. Who owns the foregoing properties? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "The house and lot shall be co-owned by B and G. Since the marriage was declared void (under Article 36) and there was no impediment between the parties, their property relation is governed by the special co-ownership rule in **Article 147 of the Family Code**. However, because the house and lot were acquired by B before the marriage and before their cohabitation, it falls under the **ordinary rules on co-ownership**, where the share is based on proven contribution.

Roberto alleged that he was then invited by his friend to join her at the wedding reception and carried the basket full of fruits which she was bringing to the affair. At the reception, the wedding coordinator of the hotel noticed him and asked him, allegedly in a loud voice, to leave as he was not in the guest list. He retorted that he had been invited to the affair by his friend, who however denied doing so. Deeply embarrassed by the incident, Roberto then sued the hotel for damages under Articles 19 and 21 of the Civil Code. Will Roberto's action prosper? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "No, the action will not prosper. The hotel had the right to ensure the wedding reception was exclusively for those who were invited to the affair, thus, the denial of entry cannot be considered as contrary to law or morals. Firstly, the act of denying entry to Roberto was made in the exercise of a right because it had basis to deny entry to the reception to one who is not in the guest list. Secondly, the act of denying entry cannot be considered contrary to morals, good customs or public policy or that the hotel wilfully caused Roberto loss or injury. On the contrary, Roberto was the one who appears to have acted in bad faith since he wilfully entered the reception of the wedding knowing that he is not one of the invited guests. Thus, Roberto’s action must fail."

        "Answer": "Yes, Ricky is entitled to recover the Pl Million. The fetus was born prematurely with an intrauterine life of only six months. In order to be considered born and to have acquired juridical capacity, the law requires that if the fetus had an intrauterine life of less than seven months, it must survive for twenty-four hours from complete separation from the mother's womb before it may be considered born and possessed of civil personality. In this case, Angela died only 20 hours after birth. Hence, she did not acquire juridical capacity and the donation in her favor did not take effect."

        "Answer": "On the assumption that the parties are governed by the regime of conjugal partnership of gains, the answer would depend on whether the cost of the building is more than that of the land. Based on Article 120 of the Family Code if an improvement is introduced on the exclusive property belonging to one of the spouses using conjugal funds, the entire property (building and the land) shall belong to the conjugal property if the cost of the improvement and the resulting increase in the value of the property are more than the value of the property at the time of the improvement subject to the obligation of the conjugal partnership to reimburse the owner spouse the value of his or her exclusive property. If the cost of the improvement with the use of the conjugal fund is less than the value of the exclusive property of the spouse, then the latter owns the entire property but he or she shall be obligated to reimburse the conjugal partnership at the time the liquidation thereof. The facts did not mention the value of the exclusive property of Maria. Hence, the aforestated rule shall apply in the determination of the issue of whether the building is conjugal or paraphernal."

Is Cipriano capacitated to re-marry by virtue of the divorce decree obtained by his Filipino spouse who was later naturalized as an American citizen? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Yes, Cipriano is capacitated to re-marry. Under Article 26 (2) of the Family Code, where a marriage between a Filipino citizen and a foreigner is validly celebrated and a divorce is thereafter validly obtained abroad by the alien spouse capacitating him or her to remarry, the Filipino spouse shall likewise have capacity to remarry under Philippine law. The Supreme Court ruled that the same rule applies even if the Filipino spouse became naturalized as an alien after the celebration of the marriage. The reckoning point for the application of Article 26 is the citizenship of the parties at the time the divorce is obtained. Hence, Cipriano may remarry (Republic v. Orbecido III, G.R.

Eager of having children of their own, the spouses made it appear that they were the children’s parents by naming them Michelle P. Lim and Michael Jude Lim. Subsequently, Monina married Angel Olario after Primo's death. She decided to adopt the children by availing the amnesty given under R.A. 8552 to those individuals who simulated the birth of a child. She filed separate petitions for the adoption of Michelle, then 25 years old and Michael, 18. Both Michelle and Michael gave consent to the adoption. The trial court dismissed the petition and ruled that Monina should have filed the petition jointly with her new husband. Monina, in a Motion for Reconsideration argues that mere consent of her husband would suffice and that joint adoption is not needed, for the adoptees are already emancipated. Is the trial court correct in dismissing the petitions for adoption? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Yes, the trial court is correct in dismissing the petitions for adoption. The Domestic Adoption Act requires both husband and wife to jointly file the petition for adoption unless the circumstances fall under the enumerated exceptions since the adoptees are not the illegitimate children of Monina and neither are they legitimate children of Monina's husband. Thus, the adoption of Michelle and Michael does not appear to be under the exceptions mentioned in the law which would permit only one of the spouses to file the petition. In the present case, Monina already remarried at the time she filed the petition for adoption, thus, her contention that her husband's consent is enough must fail because the law specifically requires both husband and wife to jointly adopt (In Re Petition for Adoption of Michelle P. Lim and Michael P. Lim, G.R. Nos. 168992-93 May 21, 2009)."

After Jambrich and Descallar separated, Jambrich purchased an engine and some accessories for his boat from Borromeo. To pay for his debt, he sold his rights and interests in the Agro-Macro properties to Borromeo. Borromeo discovered that titles to the three (3) lots have been transferred in the name of Descallar. Who is the rightful owner of the properties? Explain. ",

In such case, all the properties in question acquired by Jambrich using his salaries or wages, or the income from his business or profession are equally owned by them even if Descallar’s contributed consisted merely in the care and maintenance of the household. While it is true that save in cases of hereditary succession, aliens are constitutionally prohibited from owning lands, that defect was cured when Jambrich transferred his shares in Agro-Macro Subdivision to Borromeo, a Filipino, thus making the latter and Descallar the owners thereof.

Rosa opposes the probate alleging such lack of proper authentication. She claims that the unaltered form of the will should be given effect. Whose claim should be granted? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Gregorio should be denied probate because the holographic will with unauthenticated alteration cannot be probated.

The rule is that the will is voided only insofar as the addition or alteration is concerned, but not the whole will itself. If the testator did not interpose his/her full signature, the whole will shall be deemed voided because authentication of the changes with the full signature of the testator is necessary to save the will from invalidity. Rosa's claim to give effect to the unaltered will cannot be granted since the alterations were done by the testator herself and were properly authenticated by her full signature.

As a general rule, the right of the purchaser to the possession of the property commences upon the expiration of the redemption period and its consolidation to the name of the purchaser. In the case of extrajudicial foreclosure, the law provides that the purchaser is entitled to possession upon expiration of the redemption period unless a third party is actually holding the property adversely to the judgment debtor. The issuance of the writ of possession is a ministerial function of the court and does not prescribe in five years. The prescription of actions covered under Article 1149 of the Civil Code does not apply in such a case."

        "Answer": "No, I do not agree. The rule that a petition to declare a marriage void can only be filed by the husband on the wife will not apply to cases of bigamous marriage contracted by either of the parties. The legal spouse has standing to question a subsequent bigamous marriage contracted by the other spouse. (Juliano-Llave v. Republic, G.R. No. 169766, 30 March 2011) ALTERNATIVE ANSWER: Yes, I agree. Under the rules promulgated by the Supreme Court a petition for declaration of nullity of a void marriage may be filed solely by the husband or the wife (A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC)."

        "Question": " A contract to sell is the same as a conditional contract of sale. Do you agree? Explain your answer. ",
        "Answer": "No, I do not agree. A contract to sell is a bilateral contract; whereby the prospective seller expressly reserves ownership of the subject property, despite delivery binds himself to sell the property to the prospective buyer upon fulfillment by the latter of the positive suspensive condition which is usually the full payment of the purchase price. In a conditional sale, the seller may likewise reserve title until the fulfillment of the suspensive condition. However, in a conditional sale, the consent to transfer ownership to the vendee is present, although conditioned upon the happening of a contingent event which may or may not occur. If the suspensive condition is fulfilled, and there was prior delivery of the object to the vendee, ownership thereto automatically transfers to the buyer by operation of law without any further act having to be performed by the seller. In contrast, in a contract to sell, upon the fulfillment of the suspensive condition which is the full payment of the purchase price, ownership will not automatically transfer to the buyer, although the property may have been previously delivered to him. The prospective seller still has to convey title to the prospective buyer by entering into a contract of absolute sale (Nabus v. Pacson, G.R. No. 161318 No- vember 25, 2009)."

My ruling is based on the Civil Code provision that one who has lost any movable or has been unlawfully deprived thereof may recover it from the person in possession of the same. Tambunting's claim of good faith is inconsequential. - Article 559 of the Civil Code applies because the owner of the jewelry was unlawfully deprived of her movable property.

If you are the judge, will you grant the petition? Explain.",
        "Answer": "If I were the judge, I will not grant the petition. While the decision of the church tribunal annulling the marriage of the parties may be persuasive, it is not however, binding upon the civil courts. For psychological incapacity to be a ground for nullity, it must be shown that it was rooted in the history of the party alleged to be suffering from it, it must be grave, serious, and incurable such that it renders the person incapacitated to perform the essential marital obligations due to causes psychological in nature. In the case presented, it appears that Ariz fulfilled his marital obligations at the beginning and it was only after feeling envious about the success of Paz that he started exhibiting violent tendencies and refused to comply with marital obligations. Psychological incapacity is not mere refusal but outright incapacity to perform marital obligations which does not appear to be present in the case of Ariz (Marcos v. Marcos, G.R.

One important provision in his will reads as follows: 'Ang lupa at bahay sa Lungsod ng Maynila ay ililipat at ilalagay sa pangalan nina Alex at Rene hindi bilang pamana ko sa kanila kundi upang pa- mahalaan at pangalagaan lamang nila at nang ang sinuman sa aking mga anak, sampu ng aking mga apo at kaapuapuhan ko sa habang panahon, ay may tutuluyan kung magnanais na mag-aral sa Maynila o sa kalapit na mga lungsod.’ Is the provision valid? (4%)",
        "Answer": "I qualify. The provision conveying or transferring the title to the property to Alex and Rene is valid. However, the provision prohibiting partition forever is not valid. A legacy or devise is to be construed as a donation effective mortis causa, and it is intended to transfer ownership to the legatee or devisee. Since the ownership is legally transferred to Alex and Rene, they cannot be prohibited by the testator from alienating or partitioning the same perpetually. The law provides that dispositions of the testator declaring all or part of the estate inalienable for more than twenty years are void (Article 870). Also, every co-heir has the right to demand the division of the estate unless the testator should have expressly forbidden its partition, in which case the period of indivision shall not exceed twenty years. (Article 1083, Civil Code)."

        "Question": "The Roman Catholic Church accepted a donation of a real property located in Lipa City. A deed of donation was executed, signed by the donor, Don Mariano, and the donee, the Church, as represented by Fr. Damian. Before the deed could be notarized, Don Mariano died. Is the donation valid? (4%)",
        "Answer": "No, the donation is not valid because the subject matter of the donation is real property and hence, the formalities mentioned in Article 749 shall govern. The law requires that the donation of an immovable property must be in a public instrument and that the acceptance may be made in the same deed of donation or in a separate instrument but it shall not take effect, unless it is done during the lifetime of the donor. The donation was never reduced into a public document because the donor died before the deed could be notarized. Hence, it remained a private instrument which renders the donation void."

In 1996, they decided to live together again, and in 1998, they got married. The marriage was declared null and void under Article 36 of the Family Code. Dinah filed a motion for partial reconsideration questioning the portion of the decision on the issuance of a decree of nullity of marriage only after the liquidation, partition and distribution of properties under Article 147 of the Code. If you are the judge, how will you decide petitioner's motion for partial reconsideration? Why? (4%)",
        "Answer": "I will grant partial reconsideration. If the marriage is declared void under Article 36, the provisions of the Family Code on liquidation, partition, and distribution of the properties on absolute community or conjugal partnership will not apply. Instead, Article 147 or Article 148 shall govern the liquidation and partition of the properties of the parties depending on the presence or absence of a legal impediment between them.

The spouses would give a downpayment of P500,000.00 upon the signing of the contract, while the balance would be paid for the next three (3) consecutive months in the amount of Pl,000,000.00 per month. The spouses paid the first two (2) instalments but not the last installment. After one (1) year, the spouses offered to pay the unpaid balance which Honorio refused to accept. The spouses filed a complaint for specific performance against Honorio invoking the application of the Maceda Law. If you are the judge, how will you decide the case? (4%)",
        "Answer": "I will rule in favor of Honorio. The invocation of the Maceda Law is misplaced. The law applies only to sale or financing of realty on installment payments including residential units or residential condominium apartments and does not apply to sales of industrial units or industrial lands like in the case presented. Another reason why the Maceda law will not apply is that the sale in the case at bar is not the sale on installment as contemplated by the law. The sale on installment covered by the Maceda Law is one where the price is paid or amortized over a certain period in equal installments. The sale to the Spouses Dakila is not a sale on installment but more of a straight sale where a down payment is to be made and the balance to be paid in a relatively short period of three months."

Isaac filed an action for consignation in court of the balance of the purchase price, but he failed to give prior notice to Dorotea of his intention to consign the payment in court. Is the consignation valid? (4%)",
        "Answer": "No, the consignation is not valid. For consignation of the thing or sum due to be proper, there must be prior notice to the creditor that the debtor is going to consign the payment in court. This notice is intended to give the creditor the opportunity to accept payment and to avoid liability for costs in case it is found that the act of consignation was properly made.

Novation is the substitution of a new obligation for an old one, which must be so declared in unequivocal terms or the old and new obligations must be incompatible on every point. The acceptance by MSI of payments made by Amoroso does not constitute novation by substitution of debtor (expromision or delegacion) because there was no explicit agreement by J.C. to be released from its obligation."

Edith and Philip would like to recover the properties claiming that they should have been reserved by Peachy in their behalf and must now revert back to them. Is the contention of Edith and Philip valid? (4%)",
        "Answer": "No, the contention is not valid. The property adjudicated to Jun from the estate of his parents which he in turn left to Anita and Cesar is not subject to reservation in favor of Edith and Philip. The lineal character of the reservable property is reckoned from the ascendant from whom the propositus received the property by gratuitous title. The ownership should be reckoned only from Jun, as he is the ascendant from where the first transmission occurred or from whom Cesar inherited the properties. Moreover, Article 891 provides that the person obliged to reserve the property should be an ascendant. Peachy is not Cesar's ascendant but a mere collateral relative. On the assumption that the property is reservable, Edith and Philip being first cousins of Cesar, who is the propositus, are disqualified to be reservatarios as they are not third degree relatives of Cesar."

To fund the project, he obtained a loan form the National Bank (NB) secured by a real estate mortgage over the adjoining property which he also owned. During construction, he built three (3) pumps on the mortgaged property to supply water to the condominium. After one (1) year, the project was completed and the condominium was turned over to the buyers. However, Mr. Bong failed to pay his loan obligation to NB. Thus, NB foreclosed the mortgaged property where the pumps were installed. During the sale on public auction of the mortgaged property, Mr. Simon won in the bidding. When Mr. Simon attempted to take possession of the property, the condominium owners, who in the meantime constituted themselves into Flores de Manila Inc. (FMI), claimed that they have earlier filed a case for the declaration of the existence of an easement before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig City and prayed that the easement be annotated in the title of the property foreclosed by NB. FMI further claimed that when Mr. Bong installed the pumps In his adjoining property, a voluntary easement was constituted in favour of FMI. Will the action prosper? (4%)",
        "Answer": "No, the action will not prosper. An easement or servitude is 'a real right constituted on another's property, corporeal and immovable, by virtue of which the owner of the same has to abstain from doing or to allow somebody else to do something on his property for the benefit of another thing or person.' (Valdez v. Tabisura, G.R. No. 175510, July 28, 2008). It is to be noted that at the time the pumps were built, the property on which it was built also belonged to Mr. Bong. It cannot therefore be said that an easement was established when the pumps were installed as both properties were owned by one and the same person. It would be absurd to say that Mr. Bong constituted an easement on his own property. Thus, there is neither a legal easement or voluntary easement constituted in favor of FMI (Privatization and Management Office vs. Legaspi Towers 300, Inc. G.R. No. 147957 July 22, 2009)."

        "Answer": "I will dismiss the case for annulment of the sale and specific performance filed by Maria with respect to the shares pertaining to Esperanza and Caridad.

Fe cannot sell the shares of Esperanza and Caridad without a special power of attorney from them and the sale with respect to the shares of the latter without their written authority is void under Article 1874.

Any sale or encumbrance made by one spouse without the consent of the other shall be void, although it is considered as a continuing offer on the part of the consenting spouse upon authority of the court or written consent of the other spouse (Article 96 FC)."

As the judge, would you approve such a compromise? ",
        "Answer": "No, I will not approve the compromise agreement because filiation is a matter to be decided by law. It is not for the parties to stipulate whether a person is a legitimate or illegitimate child of another (De Jesus v. Estate of Dizon, 366 SCRA 499)."

Joe is neither a compulsory or intestate heir of Bert and their cohabitation will not vest the former with the right to inherit from the latter. The child will likewise not inherit from Bert because of the lack of formal adoption of the child. A mere ward or ampon has no right to inherit from the adopting parents [Manuel v. Ferrer, G.R.

The RTC granted the petition... the OSG filed an appeal, arguing that sexual infidelity was only a ground for legal separation and that the RTC failed to abide by the guidelines laid down in the Molina case. How would you decide the appeal? ",
        "Answer": "I will grant the appeal and deny the petition for nullity of marriage. While the Supreme Court has previously relaxed the requirements for psychological incapacity, it has consistently maintained that sexual infidelity, per se, is not proof of psychological incapacity. In the case of Tan-Andal v. Andal, G.R. No. 196359, May 11, 2021, the Supreme Court clarified that the root cause of the incapacity must be: 1) grave or serious, 2) incurable, and 3) attributable to the respondent's psychological makeup. Furthermore, the report used here was based on the narration of Kardo, his aide, and his housekeeper. Jurisprudence requires that psychological incapacity must be based on an in-depth assessment of the parties by a qualified psychologist or expert. The failure to personally examine the respondent Glenda would render the psychological report insufficient and thus, the petition must be denied (Marcos v. Marcos, G.R. No. 136490 October 19, 2000)."

In fact, the sellers themselves allowed them to occupy the house make the much needed repairs. As builders in good faith, they have the right to seek reimbursement for the value of the improvements in case the owner decides to appropriate them. In addition they have the right to retain possession of the property until they have been reimbursed the amount they spent. They cannot be asked to remove the improvements because that is not one of the options given by law to the landowner in case the builder is in good faith (Article 448, Civil Code)."

        "Question": "Can Maria be made to reconvey the property? What can she put up as a defense? (4%)",
        "Answer": "If the Deed of Donation is considered void by reason that the notary public had an expired notarial commission and the same impaired the legitime of the property, Maria can be made to reconvey the property to the extent necessary to satisfy the legitime of Jose's illegitimate daughter, provided that the woman claiming to be Jose's child can prove her filiation to the deceased. Maria can set up the defense that the action has prescribed. An action for revocation of the donation on the ground that it impaired the legitime of a compulsory heir may only be filed within ten (10) years from the time the cause of action accrues which is at the time of the death of Jose. The facts are not clear as to when Jose died but on the assumption that he died more ten years prior to the filing of the action, the same has clearly prescribed. Under Article 1144 of the Civil Code, actions upon an obligation created by law must be brought within ten years from the time the right of action accrues. Thus, the ten-year prescriptive period applies to the obligation to reduce inofficious donations, required under Article 771 of the Civil Code, to the extent that they impair the legitime of compulsory heirs (Imperial v.

That night, however, a robber broke into her shop and took everything Including Karla's two dresses. X claims she is not liable to deliver Karla’s dresses or to pay for the clothing materials considering she herself was a victim of the robbery which was a fortuitous event and over which she had no control. Do you agree? Why? ",
        "Answer": "I partially agree. X's obligation here is an obligation to do, to make two dresses for Karla, and an accessory obligation to take care of the clothing materials delivered by Karla. X shall not be liable for the destruction or loss of the dresses because the obligation is to deliver a determinate thing. Furthermore, the loss was due to a fortuitous event, robbery, provided X was not in delay. The obligation of X was to deliver the dresses on the specified day, but X failed to do so, hence X was already in default, and would be liable for damages. However, if no demand was made, X will not be deemed in default. The loss of the materials which X must return shall not extinguish the liability of X to pay for its value, because the obligation is extinguished only for the specific thing which is lost, and X must still pay for damages. X shall be liable for the loss of the dresses because she was already in default, having failed to deliver the dresses. She shall also be liable for the value of the clothing materials delivered by Karla if the latter can prove she made a demand for delivery prior to the robbery, or without proof that demand was dispensed with based on their agreement. Hence, at the time of the fortuitous loss, the debtor X was not yet in default. However, X shall still be liable for the value of the clothing materials delivered by Karla."

Can Jackie still recover the property? Explain. (4%)",
        "Answer": "The contract of sale was voidable on the ground that Jackie is incapable of giving consent at the time of the execution of the sale. Minors are incapable of giving consent to a contract (Article 1327, Civil Code) and where one of the parties is incapable of giving consent, the contract is voidable even though there may have been no damage to the contracting parties (Article 1390, Civil Code). Jackie can no longer recover the townhouse unit because if a contract is voidable on the ground of minority, the action to annul it must be filed within four (4) years from attainment of the age of majority.

Can Clta demand that Pedro pay the entire obligation since he, together with the two others, promised to pay the amount in full after one year? Defend your answer. ",
        "Answer": "No, Cita cannot demand that Pedro pay the entire obligation because the obligation in this case is presumed to be joint. The concurrence of two or more creditors or of two or more debtors in one and the same obligation does not imply that each one of the former has a right to demand, or that each one of the latter is bound to render, entire compliance with the prestation. There is is solidary liability only when the obligation expressly so states, or when the law or the nature of the obligation requires solidarity (Article 1207, Civil Code). In a joint obligation, there is no mutual agency among the joint debtors such that if one of them is insolvent the others shall not be liable for his share.

Julia claims she has no obligation to return the interest paid by Sara because it was a natural obligation which Sara voluntarily performed and can no longer recover. Do you agree? Explain. (4%)",
        "Answer": "No, I do not agree. No interest shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated in writing (Article 1956, Civil Code). In the absence of a written stipulation for the payment of interest, the payment made by Sara is one that is not due. Hence, she is entitled to recover the interest paid under the principle of solutio indebiti which arises when something is received when there is no right to demand it, and it was unduly delivered through mistake (Article 2154, Civil Code).

The placing of the title in the name of X for the purpose of holding it for the benefit of his siblings constitutes an implied trust (Article 1448, Civil Code) where X is the trustee and his siblings are the beneficiaries. An action for reconveyance based on an implied trust arising from fraud prescribes in ten years.

Conversely, an attack is indirect or collateral when, in an action to obtain a different relief, an attack on the proceeding is nevertheless made as an incident thereof. Such action to attack a certificate of title may be an original action or a counterclaim, in which a certificate of title is assailed as void (Firaza Sr. v. Ugay, G.R.

The facts state that Juliet acquired American citizenship, hence, she may obtain a divorce abroad which if valid in accordance with her national law shall also be regarded as valid in the Philippines provided that the divorce is proven as a fact in accordance with the rules on evidence in an appropriate proceeding filed before our courts (Republic v. Orbecido, G.R. No. 154380 October 5, 2005)."

        "Question": "Leo married Lina and they begot a son. After the birth of their child, Lina exhibited unusual behaviour and started to neglect her son; she frequently went out with her friends and gambled in casinos. Lina later had extra-marital affairs with several men and eventually abandoned Leo and their son. Leo was able to talk to the psychiatrist of Lina who told him that Lina suffers from dementia praecox, a form of psychosis where the afflicted person Is prone to commit homicidal attacks. Leo was once stabbed by Lina but fortunately he only suffered minor injuries. Will a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage filed with the court prosper? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "The petition for nullity of marriage will prosper. The facts presented show that Lina is afflicted with dementia praecox, a form of psychosis, which makes her unable to comply with the essential marital obligations, constituting psychological incapacity. Based on jurisprudence, the gravity of the psychological incapacity is determined by whether the incapacity is grave or serious, incurable, and rooted in the history of the party afflicted. The symptoms exhibited by Lina—neglect of her son, gambling, extra-marital affairs, abandonment, and psychosis leading to violence—point to a psychological condition rendering her unable to perform the duties of marriage. However, a conclusive diagnosis of a grave, severe and incurable presence of psychological incapacity must still be based on an in-depth assessment of the parties by a psychologist or expert (Ngo Te v. Yu-Te, G.R. No. 161793, 13 February 2009, 579 SCRA 193; Paz v. Paz G.R. No. 166579 February 18, 2010)."

        "Answer": "Yes, Dorothy's suit will prosper. Under Article 147, if the parties who are capacitated to marry each other live exclusively with each other as husband and wife without the benefit of marriage or under a void marriage, their wages and salaries shall be owned by them in equal shares and the property acquired by both of them through their work or industry shall be governed by the rules on co-ownership. Dorothy and Bernard's union is covered by Article 147, and neither party can encumber or dispose by acts inter vivos of his or her share in the property acquired during cohabitation and owned in common without the consent of the other, until after the termination of the cohabitation."

        "Answer": "If the property was acquired by Dorothy and Bernard during their cohabitation, which ended when they physically separated, the property, if found to be co-owned, must be partitioned equally between them. The law states that upon termination of the cohabitation, the corresponding share of the party who did not act in bad faith will comprise his or her share in the co-ownership. Bernard, having disposed of the common property without consent, acted in bad faith, hence Dorothy is entitled to her share in the co-ownership as well as the portion pertaining to Bernard."

Daniel took possession of the accretion since 1923, as shown by a tax declaration. In 1958, Benjamin filed a Complaint for Quieting of Title, claiming the alluvium belonged to him as riparian owner and was part of his registered property. Daniel claimed ownership by prescription. Decide the case and explain. ",
        "Answer": "The alluvium belongs to Benjamin as the riparian owner (Article 457, Civil Code). However, Benjamin's assertion that the accretion automatically becomes part of his registered property is not correct; while it is automatically owned by the riparian owner, it needs a separate act of registration for it to be covered by the Torrens title. Nonetheless, Daniel's claim of acquisitive prescription should prevail. Although Daniel's possession prior to the land being declared alienable is insufficient, the facts indicate that Daniel took possession in 1923 and Benjamin filed suit in 1958, meaning Daniel had been in possession for more than 30 years, thus acquiring the land by extraordinary acquisitive prescription."

The spouses fled and resided in Manila for 35 years. Upon returning, they filed a suit for reconveyance against Romeo's grandson (the current title holder), who raised the defenses of laches and prescription. Decide the case and rule on the defenses. ",
        "Answer": "The case filed by Joven and Juliana for reconveyance will prosper. The Deed of Sale, having been signed by Joven and Juliana by force and intimidation, is void and not merely voidable because the sale has no cause or consideration (Article 1352 and Article 1409). Hence, the title subsequently issued to Romeo's grandson is likewise void it being derived from the void title of Romeo. The claim that the right to recover possession is barred by laches and prescription is untenable because the action to declare a void deed of sale void is imprescriptible. Neither will laches apply because the delay in asserting their right could not be considered unreasonable in view of the threat to their life."

        "Answer": "No, the obligation of Butch was not extinguished by dacion en pago upon the mere surrender of the SUVs. Dacion en pago (dation in payment) requires the conveyance of ownership of a property as an accepted equivalent of the performance of the obligation. The arrangement here was merely for Hagibis to sell the vehicles and credit the proceeds to the loan, which does not constitute transfer of ownership as full satisfaction of the debt; rather, it implies a contract of agency or security."

        "Answer": "Jerico's claim that there is no novation is correct, and Jojo is not relieved of his undertaking. Novation is never presumed, and requires an express agreement or that the old and new obligations are incompatible on every point. A surety is released from obligation if there is a material alteration of the principal contract. However, the MOA here only involved a revision of the work schedule, and expressly maintained all other terms and conditions of the original contract. Since the original obligation remains fundamentally the same, there was no novation, and Jojo remains liable under the Surety undertaking (Security Bank and Trust Company, Inc, v.

Ellen sued to nullify the mortgage, auction sale, and title of Mega Bank, claiming the bank was not a mortgagee in good faith. Decide the case with reasons. ",
        "Answer": "The case filed by Ellen should prosper, and the mortgage and subsequent foreclosure are void. While persons dealing with registered land generally only need to look at the title, banks and financial institutions are held to a **higher standard of diligence**. Mega Bank failed to exercise the required due diligence when it granted the loan, as the bank relied on Julia who represented herself as Ellen, using a forged Special Power of Attorney. Since Mega Bank is deemed a mortgagee in bad faith, the principle that a forged instrument may be the root of a valid title does not apply, because the bank did not exercise extraordinary diligence."

Noel argued it was a valid sale with pacto de retro and Ariel failed to redeem. As the RTC judge, decide the case with reasons. ",
        "Answer": "I will rule in favor of Ariel and declare that the contract between them is an **equitable mortgage**. An equitable mortgage is one which, although lacking in some formality, nevertheless reveals the intention of the parties to charge real property as security for a debt. The retention of actual possession of the lot by Ariel (the vendor) and his continued payment of real property taxes are clear statutory presumptions that the contract was intended to secure a debt, rather than effect a true transfer of ownership (Article 1602, Civil Code, as implied by the answer)."

In breach of contract cases, moral damages may only be awarded if the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith (Art. 2220, Civil Code). Since the context only implies breach of contract, and there is no explicit mention of fraud or bad faith on the part of RPP, the award of moral damages is improper.

Should Arthur’s possession be reckoned from the date when the lot was declared A and D or from the date of actual possession? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "The possession of Arthur should be reckoned only from the date the lot was declared **alienable and disposable (A and D)** by the State, and not from the date of actual possession. Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act, in relation to Section 14(1) of the Property Registration Decree, presupposes that the land subject of the application must have already been classified as agricultural land of the public domain. Possession of the land while it is still classified as inalienable, no matter how long, will not ripen into ownership. Since the land was declared alienable only in 1993 and the application was filed in 1998, Arthur's possession is short of the thirty year period required for acquisitive prescription, hence the application should be denied."

Is the exercise by Peter of his power to rescind extra-judicially the proper and legal way rescinding said contract? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "As a general rule, the power to rescind an obligation must be invoked judicially and cannot be exercised solely on a party's own judgment. However, the contract here is a **Contract to Sell**, not a Contract of Sale, where Peter reserves ownership and his obligation to convey title only arises upon full payment. In a contract to sell, failure to pay the full price is not considered a breach but merely the **non-happening of a suspensive condition**, which prevents the seller’s obligation to convey title from arising.

Tomas, Jr. argued that Article 992 is unconstitutional because it prevents him from inheriting while allowing an illegitimate child of an illegitimate parent to represent. Decide the case and explain. ",
        "Answer": "I will rule in favor of Tristan. Article 992 establishes a barrier (the iron curtain rule) preventing an illegitimate child (Tomas, Jr.) from inheriting *ab intestato* from the legitimate relatives of his father (Don Ricardo). The descendants of a legitimate child, in order to represent the latter, must themselves be legitimate. Tomas, Jr., being an illegitimate child of the legitimate son (Tomas) of Don Ricardo, is excluded from inheriting from Don Ricardo.

Macario claimed his adverse claim provided notice to the world. Who has the superior right over the disputed property, Macario or Alex? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Macario has a better right to the land. Actual notice of an adverse claim is equivalent to registration, and the subsequent registration of the Notice of Levy could not have any legal effect due to the prior inscription of the adverse claim annotated on the title (Guidote v.

The doctrine of **corporate negligence** allows allocating liability for negligent acts of health practitioners.

Interest on the unpaid compensation becomes due as compliance with the constitutional mandate on eminent domain and as a basic measure of fairness. Thus, interest runs as a matter of law and follows as a matter of course from the right of the landowner to be placed in as good a position as money can accomplish, as of the date of taking (Evergreen Manufacturing Corporation vs. Republic of the Philippines (G.R. No. 218628, September 6, 2017)."

        "Question": "Distinguish antichresis from usufruct. ",
        "Answer": "Antichresis is a **contract** which gives the creditor the right to receive the fruits of an immovable of his debtor, with the obligation to apply them to the payment of the interest, if owing, and thereafter to the principal of his credit (Article 2132, Civil Code). While usufruct is the **right** to enjoy the property of another with the obligation of preserving its form and substance, unless the title constituting it or the law otherwise provides (Article 562, Civil Code). Antichresis is an **accessory contract**, while usufruct is a **principal contract**. In antichresis, the creditor does not have the obligation to file a bond upon entering into possession, unlike in usufruct where the general rule is that the usufructuary must file a bond (Article 583, Civil Code). Furthermore, in antichresis, the creditor does not have the right to introduce improvements, whereas a usufructuary may make useful improvements or expenses for mere pleasure, provided he does not alter its form and substance (Article 579, Civil Code)."

        "Question": "Jacob had been leasing a piece of land... he purchased the land from the owner, and since then he had been in open, continuous, and exclusive possession of the property. In 2017, when he attempted to register the property, Jacob learned that the Republic had filed an application for the registration of the property in 1982. What remedies are available to Jacob to recover possession of his property under the circumstance? Explain your answer. (4%)",
        "Answer": "There are three (3) remedies available to one who has been dispossessed of property: (I) an action for ejectment to recover possession, whether for unlawful detainer or forcible entry; (2) **accion publiciana** or accion plenaria de posesion, or a plenary action to recover the right of possession; and (3) **accion reivindicatoria**, or an action to recover ownership (Republic v. Guerrero, 520 Phil. 296, 307 (2006)). Since Jacob had been in possession since 1990 (when he purchased the land) until 2017 when he attempted registration, he can no longer avail of the summary remedy of forcible entry (which must be filed within one year from dispossession). However, he could still recover possession by an *accion publiciana*. In *accion publiciana*, the objective is to recover possession only, not ownership."

The current route to the public highway is a kilometer's walk through the northern lot of Riley, but the route is a rough road that gets muddy during the rainy season, and is inconvenient because it is only 2.5 meters wide. Tyler's nearest access to the public highway would be through the southern lot of Dylan. Can Tyler legally demand that an easement of right of way be established on Dylan's lot? Explain your answer. (4%)",
        "Answer": "Tyler cannot legally demand that an easement of right of way be established on Dylan's lot. For the establishment of a compulsory easement, three things must concur: (a) The property is isolated and has no adequate outlet to a public highway; (b) The easement must be established at a point least prejudicial to the servient estate where the distance from the dominant estate to the public highway may be the shortest; and (c) There must be payment of proper indemnity. The facts state that Tyler has a right of way through Riley's property. The circumstance that it may be inconvenient because it is a rough road and it becomes muddy does not justify the establishment of the easement on another's property. The **true test is adequacy of the outlet** to the public highway and not the convenience of the dominant estate."

        "Answer": "The sale made by Danny is **void**. The parties married after the effectivity of the Family Code, where the default property regime is absolute community of property (ACP). Under ACP, all properties which each spouse owns at the time of marriage, as well as whatever they may acquire thereafter, form part of the absolute community. The sale or encumbrance of ACP property without the consent of the other spouse or authority of the court is void (Article 96, Family Code). (Alternative Answer: On the assumption that the parties are governed by the regime of conjugal partnership of gains, the sale would be considered **valid**. If the land was purchased by Danny before his marriage, it is deemed his exclusive property and he may therefore sell or alienate it without the consent of Elsa (Article 111, Family Code)."

        "Answer": "I will advise Nolan that he may file an action to **ask the court to fix the period for compliance** by Zeny of her obligation to him.

The document is in reality a **suretyship agreement** because Rosella bound herself solidarily for the obligation contracted by Kevin (Article 2047, Civil Code). In suretyship, the liability of the surety is similar to that of a solidary debtor, meaning the creditor may proceed against any one of the solidary debtors or some or all of them simultaneously (Article 1216, par. 1 Civil Code).

Prior to the marriage, they agreed in a marriage settlement that the regime of conjugal partnership of gains shall govern their property relations during marriage. Shortly after the marriage, their daughter, Shalimar, was born. Before they met and got married, Sancho purchased a parcel of land on installment, under a Contract of Sale, with the full purchase price payable in equal annual amortizations over a period of ten (10) years, with no down payment, and secured by a mortgage on the land. The full purchase price was PhP1 million, with interest at the rate of 6% per annum. After paying the fourth (4th) annual installment, Sancho and Sandy got married, and Sancho completed the payments in the subsequent years from his salary as an accountant. The previous payments were also paid out of his salary. During their marriage, Sandy also won PhP1 million in the lottery and used it to purchase jewelry. When things didn't work out for the couple, they filed an action for declaration of nullity of their marriage based on the psychological incapacity of both of them.

(d) Is Shalimar entitled to payment of presumptive legitime? If yes, how much should be her share and from where should this be taken? ",
        "Answer": "(a) Shalimar is a legitimate child of Sancho and Sandy, as children conceived or born during the marriage of the parents are legitimate. (b) The property relationship to be liquidated will be that of a co-ownership. Since the parties had no impediment to marry each other and the marriage was declared void by reason of psychological incapacity, the rules on equal co-ownership under Article 147 of the Family Code shall apply to the liquidation of properties acquired during their cohabitation. (c) The parcel of land shall belong exclusively to Sancho, subject to reimbursement to the co-ownership for the payments made during the marriage. This is because Article 147 (co-ownership) only covers property acquired by the parties through their work or industry during their cohabitation, and since Sancho started purchasing the land before they met and got married, ownership retroacts to the time of acquisition. The jewelry won by Sandy in the lottery shall belong exclusively to Sandy, as winnings from gambling or betting are excluded from the operation of Article 147 and belong exclusively to the winner. (d) No, Shalimar is not entitled to the delivery of her presumptive legitime. Article 50 of the Family Code, which mandates the delivery of presumptive legitimes, does not apply to marriages which are declared void ab initio under Article 36 (psychological incapacity)."

While growing up, she developed male characteristics and was diagnosed to have congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) which is a condition where a person possesses both male and female characteristics. At puberty, tests revealed that her ovarian structures had greatly minimized, and she had no breast or menstrual development. Alleging that for all intents and appearances, as well as mind and emotion, she had become a male, she prayed that her birth certificate be corrected such that her gender should be changed from female to male, and that her first name should be changed from Sharon to Shariff. Silverio (male at birth, underwent sex reassignment, name changed to Shelley) and Sharon (Shariff) fell in love and decided to marry. They traveled to Las Vegas, USA where they got married based on the law of the place of celebration of the marriage. They, however, kept their Philippine citizenship. (a) Is there any legal basis for the court to approve Silverio's petition for correction of entries in his birth certificate?  (b) Will your answer be the same in the case of Sharon's petition?  (c) Can the marriage of Silverio (Shelley) and Sharon (Shariff) be legally recognized as valid in the Philippines? ",
        "Answer": "(a) No, there would be no legal basis for the court to approve Silverio's petition. To be entitled to a change of name, the petitioner must show proper and reasonable cause, and a change of name based on sex reassignment is not permitted under the rules. Furthermore, Silverio was born anatomically male, so there is nothing to correct in the birth certificate. (b) My answer will not be the same with respect to Sharon's petition. The court may allow the change of gender and name for Sharon because she is a biologically or naturally intersex individual suffering from a congenital defect (CAH). The determining factor in her gender classification would be what the individual, having reached the age of majority, with good reason thinks of his/her sex, and the change of name corresponds to her preferred gender. (c) No, the marriage of Shelley and Shariff cannot be considered as valid in the Philippines. Although marriages solemnized outside of the Philippines, if valid where celebrated, are generally valid here (lex loci celebrationis rule), an exception exists if the marriage is contracted between parties without legal capacity. Since both are Filipino citizens, their legal capacity and status are governed by Philippine laws pursuant to the nationality principle (Article 15, Civil Code), which voids same-sex marriage."

Each co-owner has full ownership of their part and may alienate, assign, or mortgage it (Article 493, Civil Code).

Santi is deemed a landowner in bad faith since he knew of the encroachment but did not object.

By her own choice, she remained unmarried and devoted all her time to taking care of her nephew and two (2) nieces: Socrates, Saffinia, and Sophia. She wrote a will giving all her properties remaining upon her death to the three (3) of them. The will was admitted to probate during her lifetime. Later, she decided to make a new will giving all her remaining properties only to the two (2) girls, Saffinia and Sophia. She then tore up the previously probated will. The second will was presented for probate only after her death. However, the probate court found the second will to be void for failure to comply with formal requirements. (a) Will the doctrine of dependent relative revocation apply?  (b) Will your answer be the same if the second will was found to be valid but both Saffinia and Sophia renounce their inheritance? ",
        "Answer": "(a) Yes, the doctrine of dependent relative revocation will apply. This doctrine states that where the act of destruction (tearing up the first will) is connected with the making of another will, and it raises the inference that the testator meant the revocation of the old to depend upon the efficacy of a new disposition, the revocation is conditional. If the new will (the second will) is found to be inoperative (void due to formal defects), the attempted revocation fails, and the original will remains in full force. (b) Yes, the answer will still be the same, meaning the first will is not revived. The renunciation by Saffinia and Sophia (named heirs in the second will) does not change the fact that Sydney already performed the overt act of tearing the original will to revoke it. The circumstance that the heirs named in the subsequent will renounced their inheritance will not alter the fact that the original will was revoked and can no longer be given effect."

        "Question": "Simon, a married man, underwent sex reassignment in a foreign country, changed his name to Simone, and filed a petition for correction of entry in his birth certificate to change his sex from male to female and his name to Simone. Simone later filed a petition for legal separation against his wife on the ground of sexual infidelity. His wife opposed, arguing that Simone cannot file for legal separation as he is still a male, and only a female spouse can commit sexual infidelity. (a) Can Simone legally file for legal separation?  (b) Can Simone validly obtain the correction of entries in his birth certificate to change his sex from male to female and his name to Simone? ",
        "Answer": "(a) Yes, Simone can legally file for legal separation. The law does not state that the spouse filing for legal separation must be female; it states that the offended spouse may file the petition. The Family Code defines sexual infidelity as a ground for legal separation without gender distinction as to who the offended spouse is. (b) No, Simone cannot validly obtain the correction of entries in his birth certificate to change his sex to female. Philippine law does not allow change of sex based on sex reassignment surgery, as this would conflict with laws on marriage and family rights."

        "Question": "Newlyweds Sam and Sienna had contracted with Sangria Hotel for their wedding reception. The couple was so unhappy with the service, claiming, among other things, that there was an unreasonable delay in the service of dinner and that certain items promised were unavailable. The hotel claims that, while there was a delay in the service of the meals, the same was occasioned by the sudden increase of guests to 450 from the guaranteed expected number of 350, as stated in the Banquet and Meeting Services Contract. In the action for damages for breach of contract instituted by the couple, they claimed that the Banquet and Meeting Services Contract was a contract of adhesion since they only provided the number of guests and chose the menu. On the other hand, the hotel's defense was that the proximate cause of the complainant's injury was the unexpected increase in their guests, and this was what set the chain of events that resulted in the alleged inconveniences. (a) Does the doctrine of proximate cause apply in this case?  (b) Was the Banquet and Meeting Services Contract a contract of adhesion? If yes, is the contract void? ",
        "Answer": "(a) No, the doctrine of proximate cause will not apply to this case. This doctrine is applicable only in actions for quasi-delicts (tort liability), not in actions involving a breach of contract, where a pre-existing contractual relationship exists. In breach of contract cases, Article 1170 of the Civil Code applies, concerning liability for fraud, negligence, delay, or contravention of the tenor of the obligation. (b) Yes, the contract was a contract of adhesion, as the terms and conditions were prepared solely by the hotel, and the couple merely adhered to them. However, a contract of adhesion is not void *per se*; it is only construed strictly against the party who prepared it in case of ambiguity."

Sergio later tendered the remaining balance of P1,450,000.00 to Samantha (P1.5M less P50k paid). Samantha refused the tender on the ground that she was the one supposed to pay the bills and Sergio did not have authorization to pay on her behalf. Sergio filed a consignation (P1.45M) and sought specific performance. (a) What is the effect of payment made by Sergio without the knowledge and consent of Samantha?  (b) Is Samantha guilty of mora accipiendi? ",
        "Answer": "(a) The payment made by Sergio without the knowledge and consent of Samantha extinguished Samantha's obligation to the utility company. Sergio is entitled to recover what he paid from Samantha to the extent that the latter may have been benefited by his payment (Article 1236, Civil Code). Alternatively, Sergio is deemed a person interested in the fulfillment of the obligation since he cannot continue operating the business without paying the utility company, leading to legal subrogation, making Sergio the new creditor of Samantha for P50,000.00 (Article 1302(3), Civil Code). (b) Yes, Samantha is guilty of *mora accipiendi* (delay on the part of the creditor). Her refusal to accept the tender of payment of the balance (P1,450,000.00) without just cause placed her in delay, especially since Sergio's payment of the utility bills was proper and beneficial to her."

Part of the bank opening forms was a Holdout Agreement which provided that, should he incur any liability or obligation to the bank, the bank shall have the right to immediately and automatically take over his savings account deposit. After he opened his deposit account, the Shanghainese Bank discovered a scam wherein the funds in the account of another depositor in the bank was withdrawn by an impostor. Shanghainese Bank suspected Saachi to be the impostor, and filed a criminal case of estafa against him. While the case was still pending with the Prosecutor's office, the bank took over Saachi's savings deposit on the basis of the Holdout Agreement. (a) What is the nature of the contract between Saachi and the Shanghainese Bank?  (b) Can the Shanghainese Bank legally take over Saachi's savings deposit? ",
        "Answer": "(a) The contract between Saachi and Shanghainese Bank is a simple loan or *mutuum*, not a contract of deposit. In a simple loan, the bank acquires ownership of the money and may use it, with the obligation to return the same amount. (b) No, the bank had no right to take over Saachi's bank deposit. The Holdout Agreement could only be invoked if the depositor has incurred any liability or obligation to the bank. Since the criminal case filed by the bank was still pending, no liability was yet established, and the bank failed to show that Saachi had an existing obligation derived from law, contracts, quasi-contracts, delicts, or quasi-delicts (Article 1157, Civil Code)."

A chattel mortgage was constituted on the same machineries as security for the amount. As additional security, the President of SI, Stan Smith, mortgaged his house and lot. SI failed to pay the 16th and succeeding monthly installments. SEP then commenced a collection suit against SI, and in the course of the proceedings, a writ of attachment was issued against SI’s properties, including the mortgaged machineries. The attached properties were subsequently sold at public auction, but the proceeds thereof were insufficient to satisfy the judgment credit. (a) Can SEP legally recover the deficiency?  (b) Instead of collecting the deficiency, can SEP commence extrajudicial proceedings to foreclose the mortgage on Stan’s house and lot in order to recover the deficiency? ",
        "Answer": "(a) Yes, SEP can recover the deficiency from SI. The Chattel Mortgage Law (Recto Law) prohibits the recovery of deficiency only when the creditor chooses the remedy of foreclosing the chattel mortgage. Since SEP chose to file a collection suit and pursued attachment and execution, recovery of the deficiency is allowed under ordinary contract rules. (b) Yes, SEP can commence extrajudicial proceedings to foreclose the mortgage on Stan Smith's house and lot. The mortgage provided by Stan Smith is an additional security independent of the Recto Law limitation, and the real estate mortgage provided by a third party (Stan Smith) may be enforced to satisfy the deficiency."

Since Socorro was allegedly removing portions of the land and cement that supported the adjoining property, Segunda caused the annotation of an adverse claim against 50 sq. m. on Lot A's Transfer Certificate of Title, asserting the existence of a legal easement. (a) Does a legal easement in fact exist? If so, what kind?  (b) If a legal easement does in fact exist, Is an annotation of an adverse claim on the title of the servient estate proper? ",
        "Answer": "(a) Yes, a legal easement does in fact exist. The legal easement is that of **subjacent and lateral support** (Article 684, Civil Code), which dictates that no proprietor shall make such excavations upon his land as to deprive any adjacent land or building of sufficient lateral or subjacent support. (b) No, the annotation of an adverse claim on the title of the servient estate is not proper and would be unnecessary. Legal easements are constituted by law itself, and the property is deemed encumbered by law even without registration. An adverse claim is generally required to apprise third persons of a controversy over ownership or interest, and is usually appropriate only for claims adverse to the registered owner arising subsequent to the original registration."

        "Answer": "(a) Yes, Simon may compel Shannon to reduce the agreement into writing. Although the contract is obligatory in whatever form (Article 1356, Civil Code), a lease agreement for more than one year is covered by the Statute of Frauds (Article 1403, Civil Code).

Semuel thereafter came home and filed a petition with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) for partition of the common properties acquired during his union with Sofia in the Philippines. The properties acquired during the union consisted of a house and lot in Cavite worth PhP2 million, and some personal properties, including cash in bank amounting to PhP1 million. All these properties were acquired using Semuel's salaries and wages since Sofia was a stay-at-home mother. In retaliation, Sofia filed an action, on behalf of their minor children, for support. (a) How should the properties be partitioned?  (b) Should Semuel be required to support the minor children? ",
        "Answer": "(a) The properties must be partitioned equally between Sofia and Semuel (PhP1.5 million each) in accordance with the rules on co-ownership under Article 147 of the Family Code. Since they were capacitated to marry each other, their wages and salaries, and properties acquired through their work or industry, are owned by them in equal shares. The law presumes that properties acquired while they lived together were obtained by their joint efforts, and Sofia’s contribution as a stay-at-home mother is considered sufficient contribution for her equal share. (b) Yes, Semuel should be required to support the minor children. The natural duty of parents to support their illegitimate children is mandatory under Philippine law (Article 195, Family Code). Furthermore, Semuel's denial of financial support, if committed while he is in the Philippines, is considered a criminal offense under Philippine law (VAWC Act), applying the territoriality principle in criminal law, notwithstanding his German citizenship."

SMA claims that SAL should be the one liable as it was the one who issued the ticket. (a) Should either, or both, SAL and SMA be held liable for the damages that Shasha suffered?  (b) Assuming that one is an agent of the other, is the agency coupled with interest? ",
        "Answer": "(a) Both SAL and SMA should be held liable for damages to Shasha. SAL is liable for breach of the contract of carriage because issuing a ticket covering the entire leg guaranteed that successive air carriers, like SMA, would honor the ticket. SMA is also liable as a successive carrier. The contract of a common carrier generates a public duty, and bumping off a passenger with a confirmed reservation entitles her to moral and exemplary damages. (b) Yes, the arrangement may be considered an **agency coupled with an interest**. This type of agency is established for the mutual benefit of the principal and agent, or is the means of fulfilling an obligation already contracted. In this case, the agency was created as a means of fulfilling an obligation already contracted (the carriage of Shasha), making it one established for the mutual benefit of the parties (Sevilla vs. Court of Appeals)."

He entered into an agreement with Solid Surety Company (SSC) for SSC to issue a bond in favor of the BIR to secure payment of his taxes, if found to be due. In consideration of the issuance of the bond, he executed an Indemnity Agreement with SSC whereby he agreed to indemnify the latter In the event that he was found liable to pay the tax. The BIR eventually decided against Sebastian, and judicially commenced action against both Sebastian and SSC to recover Sebastian's unpaid taxes. Simultaneously, BIR also initiated action to foreclose on the bond. Even before paying the BIR, SSC sought indemnity from Sebastian on the basis of the Indemnity Agreement. Sebastian refused to pay since SSC had not paid the BIR anything yet, and alleged that the provision in the Indemnity Agreement which allowed SSC to recover from him, by mere demand, even if it (SSC) had not yet paid the creditor, was void for being contrary to law and public policy. Can Sebastian legally refuse to pay SSC? ",
        "Answer": "No, Sebastian cannot legally refuse to pay SSC. The agreement is one of **indemnity against liability**, not merely indemnity against loss. Indemnity against loss only renders the indemnitor liable after payment is made or loss is sustained. Conversely, indemnity against liability becomes operative as soon as the liability of the person indemnified (SSC) arises, regardless of actual payment. Since Sebastian's liability arose when the BIR decided against him, SSC is entitled to recover from Sebastian based on the terms of the valid Indemnity Agreement."

In the middle of the journey, the bus collided with a truck coming from the opposite direction, which was overtaking the vehicle in front of the truck. Though the driver of the SBL bus tried to avoid the truck, a mishap occurred as the truck hit the left side of the bus. As a result of the accident, Simeon suffered a fractured leg and was unable to report for work for one week. He sued SBL for actual and moral damages. SBL raised the defense that it was the driver of the truck who was at fault, and that it exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of its driver. (a) Is SBL liable for actual damages? Moral damages?  (b) Will SBL be liable to pay interest if it is required to pay damages, and delays in the payment of the judgment award? What is the rate of interest, and from when should the interest start running? ",
        "Answer": "(a) Yes, SBL is liable for actual damages, assuming Simeon substantiated his claim. As a common carrier, SBL is obligated to exercise extraordinary diligence, not merely the diligence of a good father of a family, and cannot invoke the negligence of a third party (the truck driver) to escape liability to its passengers. However, SBL is generally **not** liable for moral damages. Moral damages in breach of contract cases are recoverable only if the mishap results in the death of a passenger, or if the carrier is guilty of fraud or bad faith. Since Simeon merely sustained injuries, he cannot recover moral damages. (b) Yes, SBL may be held liable for interests if it delays the payment of the monetary awards. The rate of interest is **6% per annum**, reckoned from the finality of the judgment until its satisfaction. This interim period is deemed equivalent to a forbearance of credit."

The **bad faith of the landowner and the builder shall compensate each other**, rendering both parties to be in good faith. Thus, the situation would still be governed by Article 448 of the Civil Code, where the landowner (Mr. P) retains the right to exercise the options (to appropriate or to compel the builder to buy the land) and the builder (Mr. A) cannot compel Mr. P to purchase the improvement."

        "Answer": "No, X Inc.'s position is untenable. While it is true that lower estates are obliged to receive the waters that descend from higher estates, this pertains only to the waters which **naturally flow** from the higher estates and **without intervention of man** (Article 50, Water Code). The facts clearly state that the waters that descended from Village H is a result of an **artificial lagoon** constructed by X Inc.. The law also provides that the owner of the higher estate cannot make works which will increase the natural flow of waters.

The cause for his disinheritance is not one of those grounds listed by law as grounds to disinherit a child or descendant (Article 919, Civil Code). The ground for disinheritance related to accusation requires the child to have accused the testator of a crime for which the law prescribes imprisonment for six years or more, and the accusation must have been found groundless.

        "Answer": "No, the position of Mr. P is **not correct**. The Statute of Frauds applies only to purely executory contracts. The exclusion of parol evidence in totally or partially executed contracts would promote fraud or bad faith,. In the case presented, there was already payment of 1% as earnest money, which is considered part of the purchase price.

In a contract of guaranty or suretyship, any material alteration of the principal obligation without the consent of the guarantor or surety extinguishes the obligation of the surety or guarantor.

The liability of a surety is different from that of a guarantor because while the latter is entitled to the **benefit of excussion**, the former is not. Hence, the creditor may proceed directly against the surety without the need of going against the principal debtor.

Novation is the extinguishment of an obligation by substitution or change of the obligation by a subsequent one, which terminates the first (Article 1291, Civil Code).

Under Article 1816, all partners shall be liable **pro rata** with all their property only after all the partnership assets have been exhausted. The liability is not solidary unless the obligation falls under Articles 1822 and 1823. The contention of X, Y, and Z (lessees) that they may suspend the payment of rentals is correct.

If the bride’s non-appearance was malicious, reckless, or calculated to inflict pain, **moral damages** are recoverable. **Actual damages** for expenses incurred (like the wedding reception) may also be recovered under the principle of *solutio indebiti* or unjust enrichment."

        "Question": "A seller posted an online advertisement for a “4-volume set of Tolentino's Commentaries and Jurisprudence on the Civil Code of the Philippines, 100 pesos only.” A Bar candidate ordered it and paid through GCash. However, when the set was delivered, the author was Lorna Tolentino (the noted actor) instead of Arturo Tolentino (the legal luminary). The Bar candidate believes that the contract of sale should be rescinded and that damages are also proper. Is the Bar candidate’s position legally sound? Explain briefly.",
        "Answer": "No, the Bar candidate’s position is not legally sound. **Rescission** or resolution under Article 1191 is a principal remedy in case of a substantial breach of a reciprocal obligation. The seller did not commit a breach because they delivered the books as advertised. The candidate merely assumed the author was the legal luminary without any representation from the seller. Furthermore, rescission under Article 1381 is inapplicable as it is not based on lesion or fraud of creditors. The claim for **damages** is also unsound because there was no legal wrong committed by the seller, and it was incumbent upon the buyer to verify the details."

In coordination with Marie, the grandparents booked the party venue, signed the contracts with the caterer and the entertainers, finalized the guest list, and paid all amount due. Marie promised to them to bring Noel to the party. A week before the scheduled birthday party, Marie decided that she would not bring Noel to the party, and that she would instead take him on an out-of-town trip on the day of the party. Marie could not forget that her parents-in-law initially opposed Benedict’s marriage to her because she has a former burlesque dancer. The grandparents seek your advice on whether there is legal basis to hold Marie liable for the damages that they have suffered as a result of her acts. What is your advice? Explain briefly.

        "Answer": "I will advise the grandparents that they may seek damages from Marie on the basis of the principle in human relations that any person who willfully causes loss or injury to another in a manner that is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy shall compensate the latter for the damage.

In 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire family had to spend 24 hours together every day in their small house. Ranza observed that although Junsi continued to work from home to support the family, he began to exhibit paranoia, and constantly kept making sure that they always washed their hands and rubbed them with alcohol ten times before eating. Junsi also always wore a face mask, face shield and hazmat in the house, except when he was alone in the room. Junsi began sleeping separately from Ranza and their children. He believed that other people who wanted to meet him in person were actively trying to harm him by exposing him to the virus. In early 2022, Ranza filed a petition for declaration of nullity of her marriage with Junsi on the ground of psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code, citing his atypical behavior. She presented the testimony of a doctor, who proved that Junsi was suffering from psychotic paranoia due to intense stress, which accounted for his belief in things that are not real. Should Ranza's petition be granted? Explain briefly. (5 points)",

The land was part of the conjugal property of Nonoy and Daday, but was registered in Nonoy's name alone. The title was later transferred solely in the name of Nonoy. Daday died. When the children of Nonoy and Daday learned about the sale to Barby, they questioned its validity since Daday had not consented to the sale. Nonoy’s position is that Daday’s consent was not required because the property was registered in his name. Is the sale to Barby valid? Explain briefly. (5 points)",
        "Answer": "No, the sale to Barby is not valid. There is a presumption that all properties acquired during the marriage belong to the conjugal partnership whether the acquisition appears to have been made, contracted, or registered in the name of only one of the spouses. (Article 116, Family Code). Even if the property appears to be registered solely in the name of either spouse, it has the inherent character of conjugal property if it was acquired for valuable consideration during the marriage. (Cordova v. Ty, G.R. No. 246255. February 3, 2021). As part of the conjugal property of Nonoy and Daday, any disposition or encumbrance thereof must be made with the consent of both spouses. Hence, when Nonoy sold the land to Barby without the consent of Daday, the disposition is void under Article 124 of the Family Code."

Agaton entrusted the original copy of the 2013 will to Karl. In 2014, Karl joined a group of mercenaries to fight in Crimea alongside the Russians. After Russia's annexation of Crimea, Karl did not return to the Philippines and was never heard of. Five years later, in 2019, Agaton executed a codicil which provided the following: 'Because of the death of Karl, I revoke my 20 J 3 will. I hereby recognize Gian as my other illegitimate son, and hereby bequeath to him my entire estate.' Agaton died in 2020. During the probate of Agaton's 2019 codicil, Karl appeared in court, presented the 2013 will, contested the validity of its revocation, opposed the probate of the 2019 codicil, and sought the probate of the 2013 will. Both the 2013 will and 2019 codicil were immaculate as to form. (a) Did the 2019 codicil revoke the 2013 will? Explain briefly. (b) Distribute the estate of Agaton. Explain briefly. (5 points)",
        "Answer": "The 2019 Codicil did not revoke the 2013 will because the revocation was based on the mistaken belief that Karl was already dead, and revocation based on a false cause or an illegal cause is null and void (Article 833, Civil Code). The estate of Agaton shall be distributed in accordance with the rules on intestacy. Despite the invalidity of the revocation, the preterition of Gian in the 2013 will shall annul the institution of Karl because Gian is a compulsory heir in the direct line who was totally omitted. With the preterition of Gian, the 2013 will is intrinsically void and intestacy shall govern the distribution of Agaton's estate, thus Karl and Gian will get equal shares."

(a) Is there a penalty clause in the lease agreement? Explain briefly. (b) As between Jungkook and Gel, who is correct? Explain briefly. (5 points)",
        "Answer": "(a) Yes, there is a penalty clause in the lease agreement. The clause making Gel liable to pay Jungkook five monthly rentals and attorney's fees in case of breach is clearly a penalty clause as it is intended to substitute the indemnity for damages and payment of interests in case of non-compliance (Article 1226, Civil Code). (b) Gel is correct. Since the parties have already provided for the penalty clause that should be paid by the lessee in case of non-compliance, the penalty clause shall be the measure of the indemnity to be paid to the lessor, Jungkook, in case the lessee commits a breach of the terms of the lease.

        "Answer": "An **immovable property** cannot be transported from place to place, whereas **movable property** can be transported from place to place without impairment of the real property to which they are fixed. Examples of immovable property include lands, buildings, and construction of all kinds adhered to the soil, and fertilizer actually used on a piece of land. Examples of movable property are forces of nature which are brought under control by science and obligations and actions which have for their object movables or demandable sums."

Flor's title was issued prior in time but was based on a dubious and fake survey plan. (a) Discuss the principle of “qui prior est tempore, prior est jure” in the Torrens system of land registration. (b) As between Flor and de Luna, whose title should be declared valid and whose title should be voided? Explain briefly. (5 points)",
        "Answer": "(a) The principle of 'qui prior est tempore, potior est jure' literally means he who is before in time is better in right. (Benavides vs. Salvador, G.R. No. 173331 December 11, 2013). Under the Torrens System, this generally means that in case of conflict between two certificates of title covering the same land, the one earlier in date prevails (Yu vs. Ayala Land, Inc., G.R. No. 173120; 10 April 2019). (b) De Luna's title should be declared valid and Flor's title voided. Although Flor's title was issued earlier, it was derived from an illegal proceeding based on a dubious, irregularly approved, and fake survey plan. A title derived from a void proceeding cannot prevail, and the rule 'qui prior est tempore' applies only when both titles were issued pursuant to judicial proceedings exercising proper jurisdiction.

The OSG argues the documents are insufficient. Should the petition for reconstitution be granted? Explain briefly. (5 points)",
        "Answer": "No, the petition for reconstitution should not be granted. In a petition for reconstitution, the necessary quantum of evidence is clear and convincing evidence. The LRA Report, which is vital to the reconstitution petition and pertains to the technical description, must be supported by the testimony of the public officer who issued it, otherwise the report is hearsay and lacks probative value. Since the public officer was not called upon to testify and be examined, the evidence is insufficient, and the petition must be denied."

The mortgage provides for a 5% monthly interest, a five-year maturity period, a default provision in case of non-payment of interest or principal, and an extrajudicial foreclosure provision. On the fourth year, Ely fails to pay interest for three consecutive months. After demand, Mia declares Ely in default and extrajudicially forecloses the mortgage, and Mia consolidates ownership. Can Ely have the foreclosure annulled and recover the property? Explain briefly. (5 points)",
        "Answer": "Yes, Ely can have the foreclosure sale annulled and recover the property. The stipulation for 5% monthly interest is exorbitant and unconscionable. The excessive interest rate taints the obligation and should be reduced to the legal rate (6% per annum). Ely was not given an opportunity to settle his debt at the correct amount (i.e., excluding the iniquitous interest). A judgment ordering a foreclosure sale is conditioned upon a finding on the correct amount of the unpaid obligation and the failure of the debtor to pay the said amount. (Heirs of Espiritu v.

At that time, their child, Amado, was only 18 months old. Lila and Christopher returned to the Philippines and settled in El Nido, Palawan. Christopher allegedly promised to give support to Amado in the amount of US$1,000 per month, but he never did. Subsequently, Christopher also settled in Cebu where he cohabited with another Filipino woman. When Lila learned of the whereabouts of Christopher, she filed a complaint against him for violation of the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act for his refusal to support Amado. Lila also invoked Article 195 of the Family Code, which provides for those who are obliged to support each other. She argued that notwithstanding their divorce, Christopher is not excused from complying with his obligation to support Amado. Is Lila correct in Invoking Article 195 of the Family Code? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, Lila is not correct in invoking Article 195 of the Family Code. While it is true that under Article 195 of the Family Code, the father is obliged to support his legitimate and illegitimate children, the defendant, Christopher, is a foreign citizen and he shall be governed by his own national law. The nationality principle under Article 15 of the Civil Code in relation to the Family Code provisions on support applies only to Filipino citizens. By analogy, the same principle applies to foreigners in that they are governed by their national law with respect to their family rights and duties."

When Maricel was 10 years old, Aurora died so Nina came home to the Philippines with Maricel for the funeral. Maricel finally met Mikael who is now 28 years old. The two of them fell in love and planned to get married. Nina objected, saying that their marriage was prohibited by law. Can Maricel and Mikael validly get married? Explain your answer.",
        "Answer": "Yes, Maricel and Mikael can validly get married. Under the Family Code, one of the marriages considered void by reason of public policy is a marriage between a legitimate child and an adopted child of the adopter. In the problem, Mikael was legally adopted by Nina. Maricel, however, is an illegitimate child of Nina, having been born out of an adulterous affair. Since the prohibition under paragraph 7 of Article 38 of the Family Code is a marriage between an adopted child and a legitimate child of the adopter, Mikael can validly marry Maricel because the latter is an illegitimate child of Nina."

The couple lived together until 2007 when JR confessed to having an affair with Elena. Inka later discovered that JR and Elena got married in 1995. Inka thus filed a criminal complaint against JR for Bigamy. In his defense, JR insisted that he could not be held criminally liable for Bigamy because his marriage with Inka in 1981 is void for lack of a valid marriage license, while his marriage with Elena is void for lack of a marriage ceremony. Meanwhile, Elena claimed that even prior to the Bigamy case, she already filed a petition for nullity of marriage before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City sometime in 2007 after learning about the marriage between JR and Inka. The RTC later declared the marriage of JR and Sena as void for being bigamous, and the ruling attained finality due to lack of appeal. Does JR have a valid defense in the Bigamy case? Decide with reasons.",
        "Answer": "Yes, JR has a valid defense in the bigamy case. Article 40 of the Family Code provides that the absolute nullity of a previous marriage may be invoked for purposes of remarriage on the basis solely of a final judgment declaring such previous marriage void. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that the requirement of seeking a judicial declaration of nullity of a previous marriage under Article 40 of the Family Code applies only for purposes of remarriage, and it is not intended to preclude an accused in a bigamy case from raising the nullity of his marriage as a defense. Furthermore, a judicial declaration of absolute nullity is not necessary to prove a prior or subsequent void *ab initio* marriage in a bigamy case. Thus, JR has a valid defense in the bigamy case."

The purchases were mainly due to the successful salon and water refilling business of Lucia. Unfortunately, the records of these purchases were destroyed during Typhoon Ondoy in 2009. In 2023, their relationship turned sour and Lucia now wants to part ways with Santiago. However, there is a disagreement on how to divide their properties. Lucia filed a case in the Family Court, claiming that she is entitled to all of the properties. Is Lucia correct? Explain briefly.",
        "Answer": "No, Lucia is not correct. The couple's property relations are governed by the rules on co-ownership under the Family Code, as they are a man and a woman capacitated to marry each other who lived exclusively as husband and wife without the benefit of marriage. Under these rules, their wages and salaries shall be owned by them in equal shares. Furthermore, property acquired while they lived together shall be presumed to have been obtained by their joint efforts, work or industry, and shall be owned by them in equal shares. Although Lucia claims the purchases were mainly due to her business, the presumption of equal sharing applies, meaning Lucia is not entitled to all the properties."

Juliette lived with her mother until Anna married Karenina, a businesswoman. Melchor died intestate. Juliette, now 20 years old, filed an action to establish her illegitimate filiation, Juliette presented her birth certificate signed by Melchor, as well as photographs of her with Melchor in their home in North Greenhills. Amy, Anna, and Karenina opposed the action of Juliette. Will the action of Juliette prosper? Explain your answer.",
        "Answer": "Yes, the action of Juliette will prosper. An illegitimate child may prove filiation by presenting a record of birth appearing in the Civil Register or a public document acknowledging the child's filiation. The rule requiring the action to be filed during the putative parent's lifetime applies only when the claim is based on open and continuous possession of the status of an illegitimate child. In this case, Juliette presented a birth certificate duly signed by Melchor, which serves as a proof of filiation under Article 172 of the Family Code. Thus, she can still prove her illegitimate filiation despite Melchor's death."

Anita was able to provide a house, a nanny, and other necessities for Marisol. Billy, however, insisted that Anita no longer needed to work if she and Marisol stayed with him as he could provide for them. Since Anita refused to live with Billy, the latter filed a petition for custody of Marisol.

        "Answer": "If I were the judge, I would deny the petition filed by Billy. Marisol is an illegitimate child, and Article 176 of the Family Code vests sole parental authority and custody upon the mother.

When they finished their studies and started earning, they decided to invest in a condominium unit together which they hoped to lease out. Since Niccolo came from a rich family and was still receiving an allowance from his parents, the couple decided that Niccolo would shell out 2/3 (P10 million) of the P15 million purchase price, while Meann would contribute 1/3 (P5 million). They asked a mutual friend who was a law student to draw up a contract which reflected the mentioned interests. The contract also had a provision that their shares in the benefits as well as the charges affecting the property would be equal. They then found a long-term tenant who rented the property for P30,000 a month. Unfortunately, Niccolo and Meann broke up and are now quarreling over their respective shares in the rental income. Niccolo insists that he should get P20,000 or 2/3 of the monthly income while Meann claims that it should be P15,000 each. Who is correct? Explain your answer.",
        "Answer": "Niccolo is correct. The parties became co-owners of the condominium unit, and the law on co-ownership provides that the share of the co-owners in the benefits and charges shall be proportional to their respective interests. Any stipulation in a contract to the contrary shall be void. Since Niccolo contributed 2/3 (P10 million) of the purchase price, and Meann contributed 1/3 (P5 million), their shares in the P30,000 monthly income must be proportional to their contributions. Niccolo's 2/3 share amounts to P20,000."

Shortly after, the Spouses Cruz filed an ejectment case against Ildefonso and Bienvenido, arguing that since the other heirs had sold 3/4 of the property, they were entitled to the possession of the property. Is the position of the Spouses Cruz tenable? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, the position of the Spouses Cruz is not tenable. Upon the death of Lani and Rufino, their children became co-owners of the estate in equal shares. Since the property remained undivided, no co-owner may exclusively possess a specific portion. Bugoy, as a co-owner, could validly sell only his ideal or pro-indiviso share in the property owned in common. The alienation made by a co-owner is limited to the portion that may be allotted to him in the division upon termination of the co-ownership. Therefore, the Spouses Cruz acquired only Bugoy’s undivided interest and are not entitled to the exclusive possession of the property to the exclusion of Ildefonso and Bienvenido."

The surrounding property closest to the public highway is owned by Renato. Willing to pay compensation, Marvic talked to Renato about granting him access to the highway but Renato refused. Renato reasoned that there is another access point for Marvic through a dirt road that connects to the public highway without passing through his property. Marvic argued that this is not convenient as it is twice the distance, circuitous, and unlit. As they could not reach an agreement, Marvic filed a complaint for easement of right of way against Renato. Should a compulsory right of way be granted In favor of Marvic? Explain your answer.",
        "Answer": "No, Marvic should not be granted a compulsory right of way over Renato's property. To be entitled to a compulsory easement of right of way, the dominant estate must prove, among other requirements, that the property is surrounded by other immovables *without adequate outlet* to a public highway. The facts indicate that Marvic has another access point through a dirt road connecting to the public highway, meaning the property is not without adequate outlet. The argument that the existing access is inconvenient because it is twice the distance, circuitous, and unlit does not justify imposing the easement on Renato’s property, as Marvic is not landlocked."

Explain your answer.",
        "Answer": "The donation is **void**. Under Article 739 of the Civil Code, donations made between persons guilty of adultery or concubinage at the time of the donation are void. Since Alejandro was married and had a clandestine affair (adultery/concubinage) with Francisca, and the donation was made while this illegal relation existed, the donation is void by reason of public policy.

They argued that Euriz is an illegitimate child who has no right to inherit from the legitimate relatives of his father, Enrico. Is the opposition of the legitimate heirs of Hilario correct? Explain your answer.",
        "Answer": "No, the legitimate heirs of Hilario are not correct. While Article 992 of the Civil Code traditionally prohibited illegitimate children from inheriting *ab intestato* from the legitimate relatives of their parents (the 'iron curtain rule'), the Supreme Court has recently adopted a construction making children, regardless of birth status, qualified to inherit from their direct ascendants by right of representation. This interpretation makes Article 992 consistent with the Family Code, which mandates support from grandparents to grandchildren regardless of status. Since Euriz is seeking to represent her deceased parent (Enrico) from her grandfather's (Hilario's) estate, Article 982 applies, which provides that grandchildren and other descendants shall inherit by right of representation, without distinguishing between legitimate or illegitimate grandchildren.

Jhosep failed to pay on the stipulated date. On March 1, 2016, Mario filed a collection suit against Jhosep. In his defense, Jhosep stated that he was not yet in legal delay, as Mario had not made a demand against him. Is the contention of Jhosep correct? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, the contention of Jhosep is not correct. While judicial or extrajudicial demand is generally required to incur delay, demand is not necessary when the obligation or the law expressly states otherwise. The promissory note explicitly provides that upon failure to pay the principal on December 31, 2015, Jhosep agrees to pay 6% monthly interest from the 'date of default'. The parties clearly stipulated that default commences upon maturity of the obligation, which was January 1, 2016 (the day following the due date). Therefore, demand was waived, and Jhosep incurred liability for the stipulated interest from January 1, 2016.

Dation in payment is the conveyance of ownership of a thing by the debtor to the creditor as an accepted equivalent of performance of an obligation. For dacion en pago to exist, there must be a transfer of ownership of the thing, and the creditor must consent to receive the thing as payment for the debt.

Will Martina be able to invoke the principle first in time, stronger in right as against Juancho? Discuss.",
        "Answer": "No, Martina will not be able to invoke the principle of first in time, stronger in right as against Juancho. Under the rule on double sale of immovable property (Article 1544, Civil Code), ownership belongs to the person who in **good faith** first recorded the sale in the Registry of Property. Registration must be coupled with good faith. Since Martina learned of the prior sale to Juancho before she registered her deed of absolute sale, this knowledge taints her prior registration with bad faith. Because Martina acted in bad faith when she registered the deed, registration will not confer upon her ownership or a better right over Juancho."

        "Question": "Rene and Sebastian, who are bitter enemies, engaged in a gunfight. In the ensuing battle, Rene killed Sebastian with a shot to the head. In the criminal case for Murder filed against Rene, the heirs of Sebastian failed to establish funeral expenses due to the inadequacy of the evidence. Still, the trial court awarded temperate damages to the heirs, declaring that it cannot close its eyes to the fact that the heirs of Sebastian indeed incurred funeral expenses. Is the award proper? Discuss.",
        "Answer": "Yes, the award is proper. **Temperate damages** may be recovered if the court finds that some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount cannot be proved with certainty. In cases where actual expenses are not duly proven, temperate damages may be awarded in lieu of actual damages. In death indemnity cases, it is undeniable that the heirs incurred pecuniary losses, such as funeral expenses, and even in the absence of receipts, temperate damages equivalent to the amount usually spent for funeral services should be awarded."

        "Question": "Carlos and Chloe scheduled their intimate wedding on September 4, 2024 at 7:00 p.m. in Manila. Chloe purchased from Angelica a gold wedding ring with engraving Love, Carlos for PHP 1,000,000.00. Angelica promised to deliver the ring on or before the wedding day. On September 1, 2024, a weather bulletin warned that super typhoon Enfeng will enter the country within three days. On September 4, 2024 at 6:00 a.m., typhoon Enteng and the enhanced southwest monsoon caused massive flooding that rendered major roads in Manila impassable to all kinds of vehicles. Angelica failed to deliver the ring in time for Carlos and Chloe's wedding which pushed through despite the typhoon. Angelica delivered the ring the following day after the flood subsided. Chloe filed against Angelica a complaint for damages. Angelica denied liability and argued that typhoon is a fortuitous event. Chloe replied that typhoon is not a fortuitous event because its arrival was earlier announced. In any event, the typhoon will not exempt Angelica because of her negligence and default. Angelica was negligent when she failed to pay attention to the forecast and was in default when she delivered the ring after the wedding. Is Angelica liable for damages due to default In complying with her obligation? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Yes, Angelica is liable for damages for failing to comply with her obligation to deliver the ring. Time was the controlling motive for the obligation, and thus, time was of the essence, making demand unnecessary to put the debtor in default (Article 1169, Civil Code). Angelica cannot use the typhoon (fortuitous event) as a defense because her default already occurred (delaying delivery past the agreed time, which was the wedding), and she was already in delay when the fortuitous event occurred."

        "Question": "Viada and Blanco are best friends. In July 2024, Blanco sold to Castan a parcel of land registered in Viada’s name. Blanco signed the deed of absolute sale in behalf of Viada and pretended as his agent. In August 2024, Viada executed a special power of attorney (SPA) authorizing Blanco to sell the identical parcel of land. Blanco executed a deed of absolute sale in favor of Sanchez Roman who was aware of the prior conveyance of the same land to Castan. Thereafter, Castan learned of the subsequent transaction between Blanco and Sanchez Roman. Castan then filed against Sanchez Roman an action for annulment of sale. Castan argued that Sanchez Roman is in bad faith because of his knowledge of the prior sale. Sanchez Roman countered that the sale between Blanco and Castan is void for lack of Viada’s consent. Castan replied that the subsequent issuance of the SPA to Blanco ratified any defect in their transaction. Who between Castan and Sanchez Roman has a better right over the parcel of land? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Sanchez Roman has a better right over the parcel of land. The initial sale to Castan was unenforceable because Blanco, pretending to be Viada's agent, acted without authority (Article 1403 (1), Civil Code). The subsequent issuance of the SPA to Blanco did not ratify the initial sale because ratification must take place before the expiration of the period within which the action for annulment may be commenced. Since the first sale was unenforceable, the rules on double sale (Article 1544) do not apply, and Sanchez Roman's purchase, made under a valid SPA, prevails."

Each of them contributed P500,000.00 to the purchase price. The deed of absolute sale named both of them as buyers. However, the title was issued only in the name of Alice who fraudulently concealed the issuance of the title from Sheila. In 2024, Alice claimed that the property belongs exclusively to her and asked Sheila to vacate the property. Sheila filed an action to recover her share in the property from Alice. Alice moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action has prescribed. Sheila countered that prescription did not run because she was in continuous and actual possession of the land. Is Sheila’s action to recover her share in the property from Alice already prescribed? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, Sheila’s action to recover her share in the property from Alice has not yet prescribed. If property is acquired through mistake or fraud, the person obtaining it is considered a trustee of an implied trust (Article 1456, Civil Code). The action for reconveyance based on implied trust generally prescribes in ten (10) years, reckoned from the date of title issuance, when the adverse party repudiates the trust. However, an exception applies when the party seeking reconveyance is in actual, continuous, and peaceful possession of the property, as the action is then in the nature of a suit for quieting of title, which is imprescriptible. Since Sheila was in continuous possession, her action is imprescriptible."

In 2020, Sheena assigned to Colet her rights and obligations under the contract of lease. Colet then paid the agreed rentals to Maloi. In 2023, Colet paid PHP 10,000.00 monthly rent through postdated checks but were dishonored for having been drawn against a closed account. Maloi charged Colet with the crime of estafa. On the other hand, Maloi demanded from Sheena the unpaid rentals and stipulated increase in rent but was refused. Sheena denied liability and argued that her obligation was already extinguished when Colet substituted her as lessee. Sheena added that Maloi accepted rental payments from Colet. Did novation extinguish Sheena's obligation under the contract of lease? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, novation did not extinguish Sheena's obligation. To effect novation by substitution of debtor, the creditor must consent to release the original debtor (Article 1293, Civil Code). Maloi's mere acceptance of rental payments from Colet cannot be assumed as an express agreement to release Sheena from liability under the lease contract and accept Colet as the new debtor."

Diana hesitated because she has no money and is drowning in debts. Yet, Jesse promised to provide for all of Diana's needs. Jesse and Diana then lived together. The following day, Jesse and Diana bought a brand-new car. The vehicle was exclusively registered under Diana's name. Celeste learned of the purchase and filed an action to recover the vehicle from Diana. Celeste claimed that Jesse is still her lawful husband, and that the car is part of their community property. Diana countered that she and Jesse are co-owners of the vehicle. Can Celeste recover the vehicle from Diana? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Yes, Celeste can recover the car from Diana. Since Jesse is still married to Celeste, his cohabitation with Diana is governed by Article 148 of the Family Code (parties not capacitated to marry). Under this regime, only property acquired through actual joint contribution is owned in common, but since Diana was only living with Jesse and unemployed, the presumption of equal contribution does not apply. As the funds used to buy the car were taken from the Absolute Community Property of Jesse and Celeste, Celeste can recover the car from Diana."

Lloyd underwent gender-affirming surgery to resemble the woman gender identity. Lloyd also changed his sex from “male” to female and his name from Lloyd” to Laida pursuant to Swedish law. Thereafter, Laida returned to the Philippines and married Miggy. Is the marriage between Miggy and Laida valid? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Yes, the marriage between Miggy and Laida is considered valid. Laida has been naturalized as a Swedish citizen prior to the gender-affirming surgery and change of name, which were done in accordance with Swedish law. Laida’s capacity to marry shall be governed by her national law (Swedish law), as the nationality principle in Article 15 of the Civil Code only applies to Filipino citizens.

Monica submitted her birth certificate where Patrick recognized her as his daughter. The heirs of Patrick opposed the complaint. Decide the case and explain.",
        "Answer": "Monica’s complaint must be dismissed. Monica is deemed a legitimate child of Anton and Steph because she was born during their marriage (Article 164, Family Code). Her legitimacy can only be impugned by the husband (Anton), and this action must be filed within the prescriptive period set by law. Furthermore, Monica is not the proper party to impugn her own legitimacy. The fact that Patrick signed the birth certificate is insufficient to overcome the presumption of Monica's legitimacy."

        "Answer": "Yes, Zion is entitled to the cash surrender value of his condominium purchased on installment. The Maceda Law grants a buyer who has paid at least two years of installments a cash surrender value of at least fifty percent (50%) of the total payments made. Zion started paying in April 2022 and defaulted in June 2024, meaning he made 26 monthly installment payments.

In his will, Caloy instituted Rebreb as the sole heir. How much can Rebreb receive from Caloy’s estate? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Rebreb can receive P34,285,714 from Caloy's estate. The institution of Rebreb as sole heir is annulled due to the preterition of the legitimate children (Teddy and Bobbie) and spouse (Grace), who are compulsory heirs in the direct line (Article 854, Civil Code). Consequently, the estate is distributed by intestate succession. The net estate of P240 million is divided among the surviving spouse, legitimate children, and illegitimate child. Following the proportions they inherit in the legitime (where the illegitimate child gets half the share of a legitimate child, and the spouse gets the same share as one legitimate child), the P240M estate is divided into seven parts (2 parts each for Teddy and Bobbie, 2 parts for Grace, and 1 part for Rebreb). Rebreb receives one part, amounting to P34,285,714."

In the mortgage contract, Rico appointed Maris as attorney-in-fact for the purpose of selling the land in case of default in the payment of loan. Rico failed to pay his obligation. Maris then purchased the land from Rico through a deed of absolute sale. Later, Rico questioned the mortgage contract because it violates the prohibition against pactum commisorium. As such, the subsequent sale is void. Is the subsequent sale void due to the prohibition against pactum commissorium? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, the subsequent sale is not void due to the prohibition against *pactum commissorium*. *Pactum commissorium* prohibits the automatic appropriation of the pledged or mortgaged property by the creditor upon default (Article 2088, Civil Code). The subsequent sale here was not automatic; it required a new deed of absolute sale. While the stipulation appointing Maris as attorney-in-fact for the sale is void because an agent cannot acquire the property subject of the agency without the principal's consent (Article 1491(2), Civil Code), the ensuing sale itself does not violate the prohibition on *pactum commissorium*."

Can Jackie rescind the contract of sale between Kiko and Bogs for the alleged violation of her right of first refusal? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, Jackie cannot rescind the contract of sale between Kiko and Bogs. The letter from Kiko was merely an offer to sell or a unilateral promise to sell, not a right of first refusal, as it was not part of the lease stipulations. Kiko offered P1,000,000.00, but Jackie’s counter-offer of P800,000.00 was not accepted, meaning no contract was perfected between them. Furthermore, Jackie gave no separate consideration for the option to buy, so Kiko was free to withdraw the offer anytime before acceptance (Article 1324, Civil Code). Thus, Jackie has no right of first refusal and no cause for rescission."

The land was classified as alienable and disposable public land in 2015. Klyde presented evidence that his predecessor-in-interest has been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation since 1990. The RD denied Klyde's application and argued that the possession should be counted from 2015 when the land was declared alienable and disposable. Is the Register of Deeds justified in denying Klyde’s application? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Yes, the Register of Deeds is justified in denying Klyde’s application. The RD lacks jurisdiction over land registration proceedings, which belong to the courts (Section 17, P.D. 1529). Assuming the RD had jurisdiction, the application was still properly denied because possession can only be counted from the time the land was declared alienable and disposable (2015). Klyde's possession prior to 2015 is not counted. Thus, from 2015 to 2020, Klyde only possessed the land for five years, which is short of the thirty (30) years generally required for acquisition by prescription of alienable public land, rendering the application unmeritorious."

Although the four-year absence period required by Article 41 of the Family Code has been met, Calista failed to show that she has a 'well-founded belief' that Sergio is already dead. This 'well-founded belief' requires diligent and honest-to-goodness efforts and inquiries to ascertain the absent spouse’s whereabouts and whether they are still alive or dead.

The disposition in favor of 'the poor in general' is valid and deemed limited to the poor living in the testator’s domicile at the time of his death (Article 1030, Civil Code).

The rules on double sale (Article 1544) apply only when there are two or more transactions constituting **valid sales** over the same subject matter. The agreement between Odrey and Jeboy is a **contract to sell**, as Odrey reserved ownership and only agreed to transfer title upon full payment of the price.

The award of damages shall earn interest at the rate of 12% from filing of the complaint until finality of the decision. SO ORDERED. Did the trial court properly impose the civil liabilities of Alan and RSA? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, the trial court did not properly impose the civil liabilities upon Alan and RSA. The liability of the employer (RSA) for the quasi-delict of its employee (Alan) is **direct and primary**, as it is presumed negligent in the selection and supervision of its employees (Article 2180, Civil Code). The liability of joint tortfeasors (Alan and RSA) is **solidary** (Article 2194). Thus, RSA should have been held primarily and solidarily liable, not merely subsidiarily. Additionally, the legal interest rate applied to damages arising from quasi-delict is **6% per annum**, reckoned from the finality of the judgment until its satisfaction.

Dr. Fuentes left for the United States, became a naturalized American citizen, and died in New York in 2007. The laws of New York do not recognize holographic wills or compulsory heirs. Can the holographic will of Dr. Fuentes be admitted to probate in the Philippines? Why or why not?",
        "Answer": "Yes, the holographic will of Dr. Fuentes may be admitted to probate in the Philippines because there is no public policy violated by such probate. The only issue at probate is the due execution of the will which includes the formal validity of the will. As regards formal validity, the court will resolve whether the will was executed in accordance with the form prescribed by the law observed by the testator in the execution of his will. For purposes of probate in the Philippines, an alien testator may observe the law of the place where the will was executed, or the formalities of the law of the place where he resides, or according to the formalities of the law of his own country, or in accordance with the Philippine Civil Code. Since Dr. Fuentes executed his will in accordance with the Philippine law, the Philippine court shall apply the NCC in determining the formal validity of the holographic will."

The national law of the testator determines who his heirs are, the order that they succeed, how much their successional rights are, and whether or not a testamentary disposition in his will is valid. Since Dr. Fuentes was a US citizen, the laws of New York determine who his heirs are. And since the New York law does not recognize the concept of compulsory heirs, Jay is not a compulsory heir of Dr. Fuentes entitled to a legitime."

Deeply embarrassed, Roberto sued the hotel for damages under Arts. 19 and 21 of the NCC. Will Roberto’s action prosper? Explain.",
        "Answer": "No, Roberto’s action will not prosper. To give rise to a cause of action under Art. 19 of the NCC, it is necessary that there must be a legal right or duty which is exercised in bad faith for the sole intent of prejudicing another. On the other hand, under Art. 21 one is liable for damages if he wilfully causes loss or injury to another in a manner which is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy. Based on the facts, bad faith cannot be assumed on the part of the hotel because it had basis to deny entry to the reception to one who is not in the guest list. Secondly, the act of denying entry cannot be considered contrary to morals, good customs or public policy or that the hotel wilfully caused Roberto loss or injury. On the contrary, Roberto was the one who appears to have acted in bad faith since he wilfully entered the reception knowing that he is not one of the invited guests."

Pietro survived. Can Marian’s baby be the beneficiary of the insurance taken on the life of the mother?",
        "Answer": "Yes, the baby can be the beneficiary of the life insurance of Marian. Art. 40, NCC provides that 'birth determines personality; but the conceived child shall be considered born for all purposes that are favorable to it, provided that it be born later with the conditions specified in Art. 41, NCC. Art. 41 states that 'for civil purposes, the fetus shall be considered born if it is alive at the time it is completely delivered from the mother's womb. However, if the fetus had an intra-uterine life of less than seven months, it is not deemed born if it dies within 24 hours after its complete delivery from the maternal womb.' The act of naming the unborn child as sole beneficiary in the insurance is favorable to the conceived child and therefore the fetus acquires presumptive or provisional personality. However, said presumptive personality only becomes conclusive if the child is born alive. The child need not survive for 24 hours as required under Art. 41 of the Code because 'Marian was already due to give birth,' indicating that the child was more than 7 months old."

However, Angela died 20 hours after birth. Ricky sought to recover the P1 million. Is Ricky entitled to recover? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Yes, Ricky is entitled to recover the P1 million. The NCC considers a fetus a person for purposes favorable to it provided it is born later. While the donation is favorable to the fetus, the donation did not take effect because the fetus was not born in accordance with the NCC. To be considered born, the fetus that had an intra-uterine life of less than 7 months should live for 24 hours from its complete delivery from the mother’s womb. Since Angela had an intra-uterine life of less than 7 months but did not live for 24 hours, she was not considered born and, therefore, did not become a person.

They married without their parents’ knowledge before an unsuspecting judge. After the couple has been in cohabitation for 6 years, Linda’s parents filed an action to annul the marriage on ground of lack of parental consent. Will the case prosper? (a) No, since only the couple can question the validity of their marriage after they became 21 of age; their cohabitation also convalidated the marriage. (b) No, since Linda’s parents made no allegations that earnest efforts have been made to come to a compromise with Conrad and Linda and which efforts failed. (c) Yes, since the marriage is voidable, the couple being below 21 years of age when they married. (d) Yes, since Linda’s parents never gave their consent to the marriage.",

They paid money to the pastor who took care of all the documentation. When Angelina wanted to go to the U.S., she found out that there was no marriage license issued to them before their marriage. Since their marriage was solemnized in 1995 after the effectivity of the Family Code, Angelina filed a petition for judicial declaration of nullity on the strength of a certification by the Civil Registrar of Manila that, after a diligent and exhaustive search, the alleged marriage license indicated in the marriage certificate does not appear in the records and cannot be found. Decide the case and explain.",
        "Answer": "The marriage of Brad and Angelina should be declared void. One of the formal requisites of a marriage is a marriage license, the total absence of which will render the marriage void. The absence of the marriage license was certified by the local civil registrar who is the official custodian of these documents and who is in the best position to certify as to the existence of these records. Also, there is a presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty."

Since Irma was already eight months pregnant by Isidro, she pleaded to the hijackers to allow the assistant pilot to solemnize her marriage with Isidro. Soon after the marriage, Isidro expired. As the plane landed in Libya Irma gave birth. However, the baby died a few minutes after complete delivery. Back in the Philippines Irma immediately filed a claim for inheritance. The parents of Isidro opposed her claim contending that the marriage was void ab initio on the following grounds: (a) They had not given their consent to the marriage of their son; (b) There was no marriage license; (c) The solemnizing officer had no authority to perform the marriage; and (d) The solemnizing officer did not file an affidavit of marriage with the proper civil registrar. Resolve each of the contentions.",
        "Answer": "(a) The fact that the parents of Isidro and of Irma did not give their consent to the marriage did not make the marriage void ab initio. The marriage is merely voidable under Art 45, FC. (b) Absence of marriage license did not make the marriage void ab initio. Since the marriage was solemnized in articulo mortis, it was exempt from the license requirement under Art. 31, FC. (c) On the assumption that the assistant pilot was acting for and in behalf of the airplane chief who was under disability, and by reason of the extraordinary and exceptional circumstances of the case, the marriage was solemnized by an authorized officer under Arts. 7(3) and 31, FC. (d) Failure of the solemnizing officer to file the affidavit of marriage did not affect the validity of the marriage.

When Eka could not take their marital situation anymore, she asked for a divorce. Du-guil agreed on the condition that Eka would be the one to file for divorce, and that the ground should be 'no fault'. After the divorce, Eka went back to the Philippines and filed a case to have the judgment of divorce recognized. The RTC denied Eka's petition because she alone filed for divorce, in violation of Art. 26(2) of the Family Code. According to the RTC, Art. 26 requires that either the foreign spouse alone initiates the filing of the divorce or, at the very least, Eka and Du-guil should have filed for divorce jointly. Is the RTC correct? Explain briefly.",
        "Answer": "No, the RTC is not correct. As ruled by the Court in Republic v. Manalo, it is irrelevant if the foreign or the Filipino spouse initiated the foreign divorce proceeding. Once a divorce decree is issued, the foreign spouse is deemed to have 'obtained' a divorce which capacitates him or her to remarry. Further in Abel v. Rule, reiterating Galapon v. Republic, the Court clarified that Art. 26 of the Family applies to mixed marriages where the divorce decree is obtained by the foreign spouse, obtained jointly by the Filipino and foreign spouse, and obtained solely by the Filipino spouse. Thus, the RTC committed an error in denying the petition."

        "Answer": "Yes, the Filipino wife may avail of Article 26 of the Family Code after an appropriate petition for the recognition of the foreign divorce has been granted by the Philippine court. In a mixed marriage, where a valid divorce is obtained abroad which capacitates the alien spouse to remarry, the Filipino spouse shall likewise be capacitated to remarry under Philippine law. However, a mere grant of divorce by a foreign tribunal does not automatically give effect to the divorce until it is recognized before Philippine courts. The starting point in any recognition of a foreign divorce judgment is the acknowledgment that our courts do not take judicial notice of foreign judgments and laws. This means that the foreign judgment and its authenticity must be proven as facts under our rules on evidence, together with the alien’s applicable national law."

F’s divorce petition was then granted by the Japanese court with finality. May the legal effects of the divorce decree be recognized in the Philippines, and consequently, capacitate F to remarry here? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Yes, the divorce obtained by F in Japan may be recognized here in the Philippines and capacitate F to remarry provided that she files the appropriate petition before Philippine courts for the recognition of the divorce decree. In Morisono v. Morisono the Supreme Court ruled there is no real and substantial difference between a Filipino who initiated a foreign divorce proceedings and a Filipino who obtained a divorce decree upon the instance of his or her alien spouse. Hence, to make a distinction between them based merely on the superficial difference of whether they initiated the divorce proceedings or not is utterly unfair. Foreign divorce decrees obtained to nullify marriages between a Filipino and an alien citizen may already be recognized in this jurisdiction, regardless of who."

Juliet promised she will be back the moment she becomes an American. After some time, Romeo learned from a friend that Juliet already became a U.S. citizen and even divorced him to marry a wealthy American businessman. Romeo filed a petition before the Regional Trial Court praying that an order be issued authorizing him to remarry pursuant to Art. 26, FC. Decide the petition with reasons.",
        "Answer": "The petition filed by Romeo should be granted. Art. 26 of the Family Code provides when a marriage between an alien and a Filipino is validly celebrated and a divorce is thereafter validly obtained by the alien spouse capacitating him or her to remarry, the Filipino shall likewise have the capacity to remarry under Philippine Law. In Republic v. Orbecido, the Supreme Court ruled that the reckoning point for the applicability of Art. 26 is not the citizenship of the parties at the time of the celebration of the marriage but their citizenship at the time the valid divorce is obtained by the alien spouse. The facts state that Juliet acquired American citizenship, hence, she may obtain a divorce abroad which if valid in accordance with her national law shall also be regarded as valid in the Philippines provided that the divorce is proven as a fact in accordance with the rules on evidence in an appropriate proceeding filed before our courts."

Unfortunately, Ted discovered that Annie and his friend Louie were having an affair. Deeply hurt, Ted returned to Canada and filed a petition for divorce which was granted. In December 2013, Ted decided to marry his childhood friend Corazon in the Philippines. In preparation for the wedding, Ted went to the Local Civil Registry of Quezon City where his marriage contract with Annie was registered. He asked the Civil Register to annotate the decree of divorce on his marriage contract with Annie.

The foreigner must file a petition under Rule 108, ROC and prove therein the fact of divorce by presenting an official copy attested by the officer having custody of the original. He must also prove that the court which issued the divorce has jurisdiction to issue it and the law of the foreign country on divorce."

However, this nationality principle applies only to Filipino citizens and cannot be imposed on foreigners. Laida has been naturalized as a Swedish citizen prior to the gender-affirming surgery and change of name which according to the given facts were done in accordance with Swedish law.

The only issue at probate is the due execution of the will which includes the formal validity of the will.

On the other hand, under Art. 21 one is liable for damages if he wilfully causes loss or injury to another in a manner which is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy. Based on the facts, bad faith cannot be assumed on the part of the hotel because it had basis to deny entry to the reception to one who is not in the guest list. Secondly, the act of denying entry cannot be considered contrary to morals, good customs or public policy or that the hotel wilfully caused Roberto loss or injury. On the contrary, Roberto was the one who appears to have acted in bad faith since he wilfully entered the reception of the wedding knowing that he is not one of the invited guests. Thus, Roberto’s action must fail."

While Gavin and Remy, who was then 7 months pregnant, were on their way to Calatagan, they figured in a car accident on 01 Dec. 2021 which resulted in the instantaneous death of Gavin and the premature delivery of Remy on the same day. At 8:30 A.M. on 03 Dec. 2021, the newborn baby died. Is the devise in favor of the baby valid? Explain briefly.",
        "Answer": "YES, the devise in favor of the baby is valid. Under the law birth determines personality, but the conceived child shall be considered born for all purposes favorable to the child provided it be born under the conditions specified in Art. 41. A fetus is considered born if it is alive at the time it is completely delivered from the mother’s womb. However, if the fetus had an intrauterine life of less than 7 months, for it to be considered born and possessed of juridical capacity, it must survive for 24 hours from complete separation from the mother’s womb. Based on the facts, Remy was already 7 months pregnant at the time she prematurely gave birth to her baby and that the baby was born alive and only died 2 days later.

When she was already due to give birth, she and her boyfriend Pietro, the father of her unborn child, were kidnapped in a resort in Bataan where they were vacationing. The military gave chase and after one (1) week, they were found in an abandoned hut in Cavite. Marian and Pietro were hacked with bolos. Marian and the baby were both found dead, with the baby’s umbilical cord already cut. Pietro survived. Can Marian’s baby be the beneficiary of the insurance taken on the life of the mother?",
        "Answer": "YES, the baby can be the beneficiary of the life insurance of Marian. Art. 40, NCC provides that 'birth determines personality; but the conceived child shall be considered born for all purposes that are favorable to it, provided that it be born later with the conditions specified in Art. 41, NCC. Art. 41 states that 'for civil purposes, the fetus shall be considered born if it is alive at the time it is completely delivered from the mother's womb. However, if the fetus had an intra-uterine life of less than seven months, it is not deemed born if it dies within 24 hours after its complete delivery from the maternal womb. The act of naming the unborn child as sole beneficiary in the insurance is favorable to the conceived child and therefore the fetus acquires presumptive or provisional personality. However, said presumptive personality only becomes conclusive if the child is born alive. The child need not survive for 24 hours as required under Art. 41 of the Code because 'Marian was already due to give birth,' indicating that the child was more than 7 months old."

Marian and the baby were both found dead, with the baby’s umbilical cord already cut. Pietro survived. Between Marian and the baby, who is presumed to have died ahead?",
        "Answer": "If the baby was not alive when completely delivered from the mother’s womb, it was not born as a person, then the question of who between two persons survived will not be an issue. Since the baby had an intra-uterine life of more than 7 months, it would be considered born if it was alive, at the time of its complete delivery from the mother’s womb. We can gather from the facts that the baby was completely delivered. But whether it was alive or not has to be proven by evidence. If the baby was alive when completely delivered from the mother’s womb, then it was born as a person and the question of who survived as between the baby and the mother shall be resolved by the provisions of the Rules of Court on Survivorship. This is because the question has nothing to do with succession. Obviously, the resolution of the question is needed just for the implementation of an insurance contract. Under Rule 113, Sec 3(jj(5)), ROC, as between the baby who was under 15 years old and Marian who was 18 years old, Marian is presumed to have survived. In both cases, therefore, the baby never acquired any right under the insurance policy. The proceeds of the insurance will then go to the estate of Marian."

However, Angela died 20 hours after birth. Ricky sought to recover the P1 million. Is Ricky entitled to recover? Explain.",
        "Answer": "YES, Ricky is entitled to recover the P1 million. The NCC considers a fetus a person for purposes favorable to it provided it is born later. (Art. 40, NCC) While the donation is favorable to the fetus, the donation did not take effect because the fetus was not born in accordance with the NCC. To be considered born, the fetus that had an intra-uterine life of less than 7 months should live for 24 hours from its complete delivery from the mother’s womb. Since Angela had an intra-uterine life of less than 7 months but did not live for 24 hours, she was not considered born and, therefore, did not become a person. (Art. 41, NCC) Not being a person, she has no juridical capacity to be a donee, hence, the donation to her did not take effect. The donation not being effective, the amount donated may be recovered.

After the divorce, Eka went back to the Philippines and filed a case to have the judgment of divorce recognized. The RTC denied Eka's petition because she alone filed for divorce, in violation of Art. 26(2) of the Family Code.

Once a divorce decree is issued, the foreign spouse is deemed to have 'obtained' a divorce which capacitates him or her to remarry. Further in Abel v. Rule, reiterating Galapon v.

In Morisono v. Morisono the Supreme Court ruled there is no real and substantial difference between a Filipino who initiated a foreign divorce proceedings and a Filipino who obtained a divorce decree upon the instance of his or her alien spouse.

A year thereafter, Wilma and Joseph returned and established permanent residence in the Philippines. If Harry hires you as his lawyer, what legal recourse would you advise him to take? Why?",
        "Answer": "I will advise Harry to file a petition for the recognition of the foreign divorce decree obtained by Wilma. He may file a petition for declaratory relief and move therein that Wilma was no longer a Filipino citizen at the time she secured the divorce and present evidence as the law of the foreign country on divorce and jurisdiction of the court which issued the divorce. I will also advise him to liquidate their properties."

Thus, Wilma went to a small country in Europe, became a naturalized citizen of that country, divorced Harry, and married Joseph. A year thereafter, Wilma and Joseph returned and established permanent residence in the Philippines. Harry tells you that he has fallen in love with another woman, Elizabeth, and wants to marry her because, after all, Wilma is already married to Joseph. Can Harry legally marry Elizabeth? Explain.",
        "Answer": "YES, he can marry Elizabeth. However, Harry needs to have the foreign judgment recognized. Article 26 of the Family Code gives the Filipino spouse the capacity to remarry if a divorce is validly obtained abroad by the alien spouse which capacitates the latter to remarry. In Orbecido, the Supreme Court held that the Filipino spouse is given the capacity to remarry even if it was not an originally mixed marriage because Orbecido’s wife was no longer a Filipino at the time she obtained the divorce decree. In the given problem, Wilma obtained divorce from Harry when the former was already a foreigner. Therefore, Harry can validly marry Elizabeth."

It appears that both in HK and MNS State first cousins could marry legally. They plan to reside and set up business in the Philippines. But they have been informed, however, that the marriage of first cousins here is considered void from the beginning by reason of public policy. They are in a dilemma.

Being foreigners, their status, conditions and legal capacity in the Philippines are governed by the law of Hong Kong, the country of which they are citizens.

Back in Manila, Anne discovered that Boni had been married in Bacolod City five (5) years earlier but divorced in Oslo only last year. His first wife was also a Filipina but now based in Sweden. Boni himself is a resident of Norway where he and Anne plan to live permanently. Anne retains your services to advise her on whether her marriage to Boni is valid under Philippine law? Is there anything else she should do under the circumstances?",
        "Answer": "If Boni is still a Filipino citizen, his legal capacity is governed by Philippine Law. (Art. 15, NCC) Under Philippine law, his marriage to Anne is void because of a prior existing marriage which was not dissolved by the divorce decreed in Oslo. Divorce obtained abroad by Filipino is not recognized. If Boni was no longer a Filipino citizen, the divorce is valid. Hence, his marriage to Anne is valid if celebrated in accordance with the law of the place where it was celebrated. Since the marriage was celebrated aboard a vessel of Norwegian registry, Norwegian law applies. If the Ship Captain has authority to solemnize the marriage aboard his ship, the marriage is valid and shall be recognized in the Philippines.

Her petition was granted by the church matrimonial court. What must Maria do to enable her to get married lawfully to another man under Philippine laws?",
        "Answer": "In Pulido v. People, the Supreme Court held that Art. 40 of the Family Code has retroactive application on marriages contracted prior to the effectivity of the Family Code but only for the purpose of remarriage, as the parties are not permitted to judge for themselves the nullity of their marriage. In other words, in order to remarry, a judicial declaration of nullity is required for prior marriages contracted before the effectivity of the Family Code. Without a judicial declaration of absolute nullity of the first marriage having been obtained, the second marriage is rendered void ab initio even though the first marriage is also considered void ab initio. The only basis for establishing the validity of the second marriage is the judicial decree of nullity of the first marriage. However, in a criminal prosecution for bigamy, the parties may still raise the defense of a void ab initio marriage even without obtaining a judicial declaration of absolute nullity if the first marriage was celebrated before the effectivity of the Family Code. In this case, Maria's marriage with Luis was celebrated when the Civil Code was in effect. Hence, she is required to obtain a judicial decree of absolute nullity of his prior void ab initio marriage but only for purposes of remarriage."

Under the Family Code, one of the marriages considered void by reason of public policy is a marriage between a legitimate child and an adopted child of the adopter. In the problem given, while Mikael was legally adopted by Nina. Maricel, on the other hand is a product of Nina's adulterous affair with a married man. Thus, Maricel is an illegitimate child of Nina.

When Faye reached 18 years of age, her parents forcibly took her back and arranged for her marriage to Brad. Although Faye lived with Brad after the marriage, Roderick continued to regularly visit Faye while Brad was away at work. During their marriage, Faye gave birth to a baby girl, Laica. When Faye was 25 years old, Brad discovered her continued liaison with Roderick and in one of their heated arguments, Faye shot Brad to death. She lost no time in marrying her true love Roderick, without a marriage license, claiming that they have been continuously cohabiting for more than five (5) years. Was the marriage of Roderick and Faye valid?",
        "Answer": "NO. The marriage of Roderick and Faye is not valid. Art. 4, FC provides that the absence of any of the essential or formal requisites renders the marriage void ab initio. However, no license shall be necessary for the marriage of a man and a woman who have lived together as husband and wife for at least five (5) years and without any legal impediment to marry each other. In Republic v. Dayot, reiterating the doctrine in Niñal v. Bayadog, this five-year period is characterized by exclusivity and continuity. In the present case, the marriage of Roderick and Faye cannot be considered as a marriage of exceptional character, because there were two legal impediments during their cohabitation: (1) minority on the part of Faye, during the first two years of cohabitation; and (2) lack of legal capacity, since Faye married Brad at the age of 18. Accordingly, the required five-year cohabitation period was not met for not being continuous and exclusive.

Is the marriage of Facundo and Quercia valid, despite the absence of a marriage license? Explain.",

The cohabitation of Facundo and Quercia from the time of death of Petra up to the time of their marriage on 01 July 2002 met the five-year cohabitation requirement therefore making their marriage despite the lack of a marriage license valid."

        "Answer": "The marriage between Gigi and Ric is void because a minister has no authority to solemnize a marriage between contracting parties who were both not members of the minister's religious sect. Under the Family Code, a minister or a priest has authority to solemnize a marriage but only if one or both contracting parties are members of the religious sect of the priest or minister. Since neither Ric nor Gigi was a member of the Baptist Church because both of them were Catholic, the Baptist Minister did not have authority to solemnize their marriage. Ric and Gigi cannot claim that they believed in good faith and that the Baptist Minister had the authority to solemnize the marriage and invoke Art. 35(2), FC to make the marriage valid. The provision of the Family Code applies only to a mistake of fact, and not to a mistake of law. Hence the fact that the Minister's license was expired will not affect the validity of the marriage if Ric or Gigi believed in good faith that the Minister had a valid license. That would be a mistake of fact. However, believing that the Minister had authority to solemnize the marriage even if none of the contracting parties was a member of the Minister's religious sect is a mistake of law. This is because the law expressly provides that the Minister has authority only if one or both contracting parties are members of the Minister's religious sect. (Art. 7(2), FC) A mistake of law does not excuse from non-compliance."

His second, with Carla, produced two (2) sons: Jon and Ryan. His third, with Elena, bore him no children although Elena has a daughter, Jane, from a previous relationship. His last, with Fe, produced no biological children but they informally adopted without court proceedings, Sandy's now 13 years old, whom they consider as their own. Sandy was orphaned as a baby and was entrusted to them by the midwife who attended Sandy's birth. All the children, including Amy, now live with Andrew in his house. Can Jon and Jane legally marry?",
        "Answer": "YES. Jon and Jane can marry each other; Jon is an illegitimate child of Andrew while Jane is a child of Elena from a previous relationship. Thus, their marriage is not one of the prohibited marriages enumerated under Art. 38, FC."

        "Question": "In 1981, JR married then 16-year-old Inka in a civil ceremony solemnized by the Mayor in their hometown. The couple lived together until 2007 when JR confessed to having an affair with Elena. Inka later discovered that JR and Elena got married in 1995. Inka thus filed a criminal complaint against JR for Bigamy. In his defense, JR insisted that he could not be held criminally liable for Bigamy because his marriage with Inka in 1981 is void for lack of a valid marriage license, while his marriage with Elena is void for lack of a marriage ceremony. Meanwhile, Elena claimed that even prior to the Bigamy case, she already filed a petition for nullity of marriage before the RTCJ of Quezon City sometime in 2007 after learning about the marriage between JR and Inka. The RTC later declared the marriage of JR and Elena as void for being bigamous, and the ruling attained finality due to lack of appeal. Does JR have a valid defense in the Bigamy case? Decide with reasons.",
        "Answer": "Yes, JR has a valid defense in the bigamy case. Art. 40 of the Family Code provides that the absolute nullity of a previous marriage may be invoked for purposes of remarriage on the basis solely of a final judgment declaring such previous marriage void. In the recent case of Pulido vs. People which involves a similar set of facts as in the problem presented, the Supreme Court ruled that the requirement of seeking a judicial declaration of nullity of a previous marriage under Art. 40 of the Family Code applies only for purposes of remarriage. It is not the intent of Art. 40 to preclude an accused in a bigamy case from raising the nullity of his marriage as a defense in a bigamy case. It would, thus, be unfair if the accused will not be permitted to raise such nullity in a prosecution for bigamy when the clear intent of Article 40 is to require such judicial decree of nullity only for the purpose of remarriage. Further in Pulido, the Court held that a judicial declaration of absolute nullity is not necessary to prove a prior or subsequent void ab initio marriage in a bigamy case. Thus, JR has a valid defense in the bigamy case."

In 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire family had to spend 24 hours together every day in their small house. Razna observed that although Junsi continued to work from home to support the family, he began to exhibit paranoia, and constantly kept making sure that they always washed their hands and rubbed them with alcohol 10 times before eating. Junsi also always wore a face mask, face shield and hazmat in the house, except when he was alone in the room. Junsi began sleeping separately from Razna and their children. He believed that other people who wanted to meet him in person were actively trying to harm him by exposing him to the virus. In early 2022, Razna filed a petition for declaration of nullity of her marriage with Junsi on the ground of psychological incapacity under Art. 36 of the Family Code, citing his atypical behavior. She presented the testimony of a doctor, who proved that Junsi was suffering from psychotic paranoia due to intense stress, which accounted for his belief in things that are not real. Should Razna's petition be granted? Explain briefly.",
        "Answer": "NO, Razna's petition should not be granted. Psychological incapacity has been ruled to be a legal concept and not a medical concept. (Tan-Andal v. Andal, G.R. No. 196359, 11 May 2021) Here, the fact that Junsi was suffering from psychotic paranoia does not make him automatically unable to comply with essential marital obligations. Based on the facts, despite his atypical behavior, he still continues to work and support his family. To be considered a ground to declare the marriage void, the psychological incapacity must be shown to be a durable or enduring aspect of a person's personality, called 'personality structure,' which manifests itself through clear acts of dysfunctionality that undermines the family. The spouse's personality structure must make it impossible for him or her to understand and, more important, to comply with his or her essential marital obligations. The supposed behavior of Jusni was stress-induced and does not form part of his personality structure. Thus, based on the standards in Tan-Andal, Jusni is not psychologically incapacitated."

        "Question": "Kardo met Glenda as a young lieutenant and after a whirlwind courtship, they were married. In the early part of his military career, Kardo was assigned to different places all over the country, but Glenda refused to accompany him as she preferred to live in her hometown. They did not live together until the 12th year of their marriage when Kardo had risen up the ranks and was given his own command. They moved to living quarters in Fort Gregorio. One day, while Kardo was away on official business, one of his military aides caught Glenda having sex with the corporal assigned as Kardo's driver. The aide immediately reported the matter to Kardo who rushed home to confront his wife. Glenda readily admitted the affair and Kardo sent her away in anger. Kardo would later come to know the true extent of Glenda's unfaithfulness from his aides, his household staff, and former neighbors who informed him that Glenda has had intimate relations with various men throughout their marriage whenever Kardo was away on assignment. Kardo filed a petition for declaration of nullity of marriage under Art. 36, FC. Based on interviews from Kardo, his aide, and the housekeeper, a psychologist testified that Glenda's habitual infidelity was due to her affliction with Histrionic Personality Disorder, an illness characterized by excessive emotionalism and uncontrollable attention-seeking behavior rooted in Glenda's abandonment as a child by her father. Kardo himself, his aide, and his housekeeper also testified in court. The RTC granted the petition, relying on the liberality espoused by Te v. Te and Azcueta v. Republic. However, the OSG filed an appeal, arguing that sexual infidelity was only a ground for legal separation and that the RTC failed to abide by the guidelines laid down in the Molina case. How would you decide the appeal?",
        "Answer": "I would dismiss the appeal. In the landmark case of Tan Andal v. Andal, the Court categorically abandoned the second Molina guideline. Psychological incapacity is neither a mental incapacity nor a personality disorder that must be proven through expert opinion. Ordinary witnesses who have been present in the life of the spouses before the latter contracted marriage may testify on behaviors that they have consistently observed from the supposedly incapacitated spouse."

        "Question": "You are a Family Court judge and before you is a Petition for the Declaration of Nullity of Marriage (under Art. 36, FC) filed by Maria against Neil. Maria claims that Neil is psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential obligations of marriage because Neil is a drunkard, a womanizer, a gambler, and a mama's boy—traits that she never knew or saw when Neil was courting her. Although summoned, Neil did not answer Maria's petition and never appeared in court. To support her petition, Maria presented three witnesses—herself, Dr. Elsie Chan, and Ambrosia. Dr. Chan testified on the psychological report on Neil that she prepared. Since Neil never acknowledged nor responded to her invitation for interviews, her report is solely based on her interviews with Maria and the spouses' minor children. Dr. Chan concluded that Neil is suffering from Narcissistic Personality Disorder, an ailment that she found to be already present since Neil's early adulthood and one that is grave and incurable. Maria testified on the specific instances when she found Neil drunk, with another woman, or squandering the family's resources in a casino. Ambrosia, the spouses' current household help, corroborated Maria's testimony. On the basis of the evidence presented, will you grant the petition?",
        "Answer": "YES, I will grant the petition. In the case of Tan-Andal v. Andal, the Court unanimously modified the interpretation of the requirements of psychological incapacity as a ground for declaration of nullity of marriage found in Art. 36, FC. With respect to gravity, the requirement is retained, not in the sense that psychological incapacity must be shown to be a serious or dangerous illness, but that 'mild characterological peculiarities, mood changes, occasional emotional outbursts' are excluded. The psychological incapacity cannot be mere 'refusal, neglect, or difficulty, much less ill will.' In other words, it must be shown that the incapacity is caused by a genuinely serious psychic cause. With respect to juridical antecedence, difficult to prove as it may be, it is still required to be proven as it is an explicit requirement of the law. Art. 36, FC is clear that the psychological incapacity must be existing 'at the time of the celebration' of the marriage,' even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization. This distinguishes psychological incapacity from divorce. With respect to incurability, it is not in the medical, but in the legal sense; hence, the third Molina guideline is amended accordingly, which means that the incapacity is so enduring and persistent with respect to a specific partner and contemplates a situation where the couple's respective personality structures are so incompatible and antagonistic that the only result of the union would be the inevitable and irreparable breakdown of the marriage."

        "Question": "Miko and Dinah started to live together as husband and wife without the benefit of marriage in 1984. 10 years after, they separated. In 1996, they decided to live together again, and in 1998, they got married. On 17 Feb. 2001, Dinah filed a complaint for declaration of nullity of her marriage with Miko on the ground of psychological incapacity under Art. 36, FC. The court rendered the following decision: 1. 'Declaring the marriage null and void; 2. Dissolving the regime of absolute community of property; and 3. Declaring that a decree of absolute nullity of marriage shall only be issued after liquidation, partition and distribution of the parties' properties under Art. 147, FC. Dinah filed a motion for partial reconsideration questioning the portion of the decision on the issuance of a decree of nullity of marriage only after the liquidation, partition and distribution of properties under Art. 147, FC. If you are the judge, how will you decide petitioner's motion for partial reconsideration? Why?",
        "Answer": "I will grant partial reconsideration. If the marriage is declared void under Art. 36, FC the provisions of the Family Code on liquidation, partition, and distribution of the properties on absolute community or conjugal partnership will not apply but rather Art. 147 or 148, FC depending on the presence or absence of a legal impediment between them. In Diño v. Diño, the SC ruled that Art. 50, FC and Sec. 19 of the Rules on Declaration of Nullity apply only to marriages that are declared void ab initio or annulled by final judgment under Arts. 40 and 45, FC. In short, Art. 50, FC does not apply to marriages that are declared void ab initio under Art. 36, FC which should be declared void without waiting for the liquidation of the properties of the parties."

If there is no marriage settlement, the salary of a 'spouse' in an adulterous marriage belongs to the conjugal partnership of gains.",
        "Answer": "FALSE. In an adulterous relationship, the salary of a married partner belongs to the absolute community or conjugal partnership of such married partner with his or her lawful spouse. Under Art. 148, FC, the property relations between married partner and his/her paramour is governed by ordinary co-ownership where the partners become co-owners only when they contributed to the acquisition of the property. The paramour is deemed to have not contributed to the earning of the salary of the married partner."

        "Question": "Before they married in 2000, Nonoy and Daday signed a marriage settlement wherein they agreed that their property relations as husband and wife would be governed by the conjugal partnership of gains. While the marriage was subsisting, they acquired a parcel of land using conjugal funds. The Register of Deeds issued a transfer certificate of title over the said land in the name of 'Nonoy, married to Daday'. Nonoy sold the parcel of land to Barby without Daday's consent. Daday was not aware of the sale and did not sign the contract of sale. A year after Nonoy and Barby signed the contract of sale, Daday died. When the children of Nonoy and Daday learned about the sale to Barby, they questioned its validity since Daday had not consented to the sale. Nonoy's position is that Daday's consent was not required because the property was registered in his name. Is the sale to Barby valid? Explain briefly.",
        "Answer": "NO, the sale to Barby is not valid. There is a presumption that all properties acquired during the marriage belong to the conjugal partnership whether the acquisition appears to have been made, contracted, or registered in the name of only one of the spouses. (Art. 116, FC) The fact that a spouse is identified as the sole vendee in the deed, and registered owner in the certificate of title does not destroy the conjugal nature of the property as the registration is not conclusive evidence of the exclusive ownership of either the husband or the wife. Even if the property appears to be registered solely in the name of either spouse, it has the inherent character of conjugal property if it was acquired for valuable consideration during the marriage. (Cordova v. Ty, G.R. No. 246255, 03 Feb. 2021) As part of the conjugal property of Nonoy and Daday, any disposition or encumbrance thereof must be made with the consent of both spouses. Hence, when Nonoy sold the land to Barby without the consent of Daday, the disposition is void under Art. 124 of the FC."

        "Question": "Maria, wife of Pedro, withdrew P5 Million from their conjugal funds. With this money, she constructed a building on a lot which she inherited from her father. Is the building conjugal or paraphernal? Reasons.",
        "Answer": "IT DEPENDS. If the value of the building is more than the value of the land, the building is conjugal and the land becomes conjugal property under Art. 120, FC. This is a case of reverse accession, where the building is considered as the principal and the land, the accessory. If, on the other hand, the value of the land is more than the value of the building, then the ordinary rule of accession applies where the land is the principal and the building, the accessory. In such case, the land remains paraphernal property and the building becomes paraphernal property."

They agreed on a fair price of P2 Million. Ray sent Linda a letter confirming his intention to buy the property. Later, another couple, Bernie and Elena, offered a similar house at a lower price of P1.5 Million. But Ray insisted on buying the house of Biong and Linda for sentimental reasons. Ray prepared a deed of sale to be signed by the couple and a manager's check for P2 Million. After receiving the P2 Million, Biong signed the deed of sale. However, Linda was not able to sign it because she was abroad. On her return, she refused to sign the document saying she changed her mind. Linda filed suit for nullification of the deed of sale and for moral and exemplary damages against Ray. Will the suit proper?",
        "Answer": "YES, the suit for nullification of the deed of sale will prosper. Sale of community property requires written consent of both spouses. The failure or refusal of Linda to affix her signature on the deed of sale, coupled with her express declaration of opposing the sale negates any valid consent on her part. The consent of Biong by himself is insufficient to effect a valid sale of community property. (Art. 96, FC; Abalos v. Macatangay, G.R. No. 155043, 30 Sept. 2004) However, Linda will not be entitled to damages because Ray is not in any way in bad faith."

In 1992, they jointly acquired a residential house and lot, as well as a condominium unit in Makati. In 1995, they decided to change their property relations to the regime of complete separation of property. Mila consented, as she was then engaged in a lucrative business. The spouses then signed a private document dissolving their conjugal partnership and agreeing on a complete separation of property.

        "Question": "In 1973, Mauricio, a Filipino pensioner of the U.S. Government, contracted a bigamous marriage with Erlinda, despite the fact that his first wife, Carol, was still living. In 1975, Mauricio and Erlinda jointly bought a parcel of rice land, with the title being placed jointly in their names. Shortly thereafter, they purchased another property (a house and lot) which was placed in her name alone as the buyer. In 1981, Mauricio died, and Carol promptly filed an action against Erlinda to recover both the Riceland and the house and lot, claiming them to be conjugal property of the first marriage. Erlinda contends that she and the late Mauricio were co-owners of the Riceland; and with respect to the house and lot, she claims she is the exclusive owner. Assuming she fails to prove that she had actually used her own money in either purchase, how do you decide the case?",
        "Answer": "Under Art. 148, FC, which applies to bigamous marriages, only the properties through their actual joint contribution of money, property or industry shall be owned by them in common in proportion to their respective contributions. Moreover, if one of the parties is validly married to another, his share in the co-ownership shall accrue to the absolute community, conjugal partnership existing in such valid marriage. Thus, in this case, since Erlinda failed to prove that she used her own money to buy the Riceland and house and lot, she cannot claim to be the co-owner of the Riceland nor the exclusive owner of the house and lot. Such properties are Mauricio's. And since his share accrues to the conjugal partnership with Carol, Carol can validly claim such properties to the exclusion of Erlinda. (Art. 144, NCC)"

Prior to the marriage, they agreed in a marriage settlement that the regime of conjugal partnership of gains shall govern their property relations during marriage. Shortly after the marriage, their daughter, Shalimar, was born. Before they met and got married, Sancho purchased a parcel of land on installment, under a Contract of Sale, with the full purchase price payable in equal annual amortizations over a period of 10 years, with no down payment, and secured by a mortgage on the land. The full purchase price was PhP1 million, with interest at the rate of 6% per annum. After paying the 4th annual installment, Sancho and Sandy got married, and Sancho completed the payments in the subsequent years from his salary as an accountant. The previous payments were also paid out of his salary. During their marriage, Sandy also won PhP1 million in the lottery and used it to purchase jewelry. When things didn't work out for the couple, they filed an action for declaration of nullity of their marriage based on the psychological incapacity of both of them.

In the Contracts to Sell, Jambrich and Descallar were referred to as the buyers. When the Deed of Absolute Sale was presented for registration before the Register of Deeds, it was refused because Jambrich was an alien and could not acquire alienable lands of the public domain. After Jambrich and Descallar separated, Jambrich purchased an engine and some accessories for his boat from Borromeo. To pay for his debt, he sold his rights and interests in the Agro-Macro properties to Borromeo. Borromeo discovered that titles to the 3 lots have been transferred in the name of Descallar. Who is the rightful owner of the properties? Explain.",
        "Answer": "It depends. On the assumption that the FC is the applicable law, the ownership of the properties depends on whether or not Jambrich and Descallar are capacitated to marry each other during their cohabitation, and whether or not both have contributed funds for the acquisition of the properties. If both of them were capacitated to marry each other, Art. 147 of the FC will apply to their property relations and the properties in question are owned by them in equal shares even though all the funds used in acquiring the properties came only from the salaries or wages or the income of Jambrich from his business or profession. In such a case, while Jambrich is disqualified to own any part of the properties, his subsequent transfer of all his interest therein to Borromeo, a Filipino, was valid as it removed the disqualification. In such case, the properties are owned by Borromeo and Descallar in equal shares. If, on the other hand, Jambrich and Descallar were not capacitated to marry each other, Art. 153, FC governs their property relations. Under this regime, Jambrich and Descallar are owners of the properties but only if both of them contributed in their acquisition. If all the funds used in acquiring the properties in question came from Jambrich, the entire property is his even though he is disqualified from owning it. His subsequent transfer to Borromeo, however, is valid as it removed the disqualification. In such case, all of the properties are owned by Borromeo. If, on the other hand, Descallar contributed to their acquisition, the properties are co-owned by Descallar and Borromeo in proportion to the respective contributions of Descallar and Jambrich."

An apartment unit donated to B by an uncle on 19 June 1987. Who owns the foregoing properties? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Since the marriage was declared void ab initio in 2001, no absolute community or conjugal partnership was ever established between B and G. Their property relation is governed by a 'special co-ownership' under Art. 147, FC because they were capacitated to marry each other. Under Art. 147, FC wages and salaries of the 'former spouses' earned during their cohabitation shall be owned by them in equal shares while properties acquired thru their work for industry shall be owned by them in proportion to their respective contributions. Care and maintenance of the family is recognized as a valuable contribution. In the absence of proof as to the value of their respective contributions, they shall share equally. If ownership of the house and lot was acquired by B on 03 Aug. 1988 at the time he bought it on installment before he got married, he shall remain owner of the house and lot but he must reimburse G for all the amounts she advanced to pay the purchase price and for one-half share in the last payment from their joint income. In such case, the house and lot were not acquired during their cohabitation, hence, are not co-owned by B and G. But if the ownership of the house and lot was acquired during the cohabitation, the house and lot will be owned as follows: i. 1/3 of the house and lot is owned by B. He is an undivided co-owner to that extent for his contributions in its acquisition in the form of the down payment he made before the celebration of the marriage. The money he used to pay the down payment was not earned during the cohabitation, hence, it is his exclusive property. ii. 1/3 of the house and lot is owned by G. She is an undivided co-owner to the extent for her contribution in its acquisition when she paid 1/3 of the purchase price using the gift from her parents. Although the gift was acquired by G during her cohabitation with B, it is her exclusive property. It did not consist of wage or salary or fruit of her work or industry. iii. 1/3 of the house is co-owned by B and G because the payment came from their co-owned funds, i.e., their joint income during their cohabitation which is shared by them equally in the absence of any proof to the contrary. After summing up their prospective shares, B and G are undivided co-owners of the house and lot in equal shares. As to the apartment, it is owned exclusive by B because he acquired it before their cohabitation. Even if he acquired it during their cohabitation, it will still be his exclusive property because it did not come from his wage or salary, or from his work or industry.

A house and lot acquired by B on 03 Aug. 1988, 1/3 of the purchase price (representing down payment) of which he paid; 1/3 was paid by G on 14 Feb. 1990 out of a cash gift given to her by her parents on her graduation on 06 Apr. 1989; and the balance was paid out of the spouses' joint income; and 2. An apartment unit donated to B by an uncle on 19 June 1987. If G and B had married on 03 July 1987 and their marriage was dissolved in 2007, who owns the properties? Explain.",
        "Answer": "The answer is the same as in letter A. Since the parties to the marriage which was later declared void ab initio were capacitated to marry each other, the applicable law under the NCC was Art. 144. This Article is substantially the same as Art. 147, FC. Hence, the determination of ownership will remain the same as in question A. And even assuming that the two provisions are not the same, Art. 147, FC is still the law that will govern the property relations of B and G because under Art. 256, the FC has retroactive effect insofar as it does not prejudice or impair vested or acquired rights under the NCC or other laws. Applying Art. 147, FC retroactively to the case of G and B will not impair any vested right. Until the declaration of nullity of the marriage under the FC, B and G have not yet acquired any vested right over the properties acquired during their cohabitation."

        "Question": "In 1997, B and G started living together without the benefit of marriage. The relationship produced one offspring, Venus. The couple acquired a residential lot in Parañaque. After four (4) years or in 2001, G having completed her 4-year college degree as a full-time student, she and B contracted marriage without a license. The marriage of B and G was, two years later, declared null and void due to the absence of a marriage license. If you were the judge who declared the nullity of the marriage, to whom would you award the lot? Explain briefly.",
        "Answer": "Since the marriage was null and void, no Absolute Community or Conjugal Partnership was established between B and G. Their properties are governed by the 'special co-ownership' provision of Art. 147, FC because both B and G were capacitated to marry each other. The said Article provides that when a man and a woman who are capacitated to marry each other, live exclusively with each other as husband and wife without the benefit of marriage, or under a void marriage: (1) their wages and salaries shall be owned by them in equal shares; and (2) property acquired by both of them through their work or industry shall be governed by the rules on co-ownership. In co-ownership, the parties are co-owners if they contributed something of value in the acquisition of the property. Their share is in proportion to their respective contributions. In an ordinary co-ownership the care and maintenance of the family is not recognized as a valuable contribution for the acquisition of a property. In the Art. 147 'special co-ownership', however, care and maintenance is recognized as a valuable contribution which will entitle the contributor to half of the property acquired. Having been acquired during their cohabitation, the residential lot is presumed acquired through their joint work and industry under Art. 147, hence B and G are co-owners of the said property in equal shares. Art. 147 also provides that when a party to the void marriage was in bad faith, he forfeits his share in the co-ownership in favor of the common children or descendants. In default of children or descendants, the forfeited share shall belong to the innocent party. In the foregoing problem, there is no showing that one party was in bad faith. Hence, both shall be presumed in good faith and no forfeiture shall take place."

The Mayor was not there, but the Mayor's secretary asked Michael and Anna and their witnesses to fill up and sign the required marriage contract forms. The secretary then told them to wait and went out to look for the Mayor who was attending a wedding in a neighboring municipality. When the secretary caught up with the Mayor at the wedding reception, she showed him the marriage contract forms and told him that the couple and their witnesses were waiting in his office. The Mayor forthwith signed all the copies of the marriage contract, gave them to the secretary who returned to the Mayor's office. She then gave copies of the marriage contract to the parties and told Michael and Anna that they were already married. Thereafter, the couple lived together as husband and wife, and had three sons. What governs the properties acquired by the couple? Explain.",

Rizza is not employed, stays at home, and takes charge of the household. After living together for a little over twenty years, Luis was able to save from his salary earnings during that period the amount of P200,000.00 presently deposited in a bank. A house and lot worth P500,000.00 used by the common-law spouses to purchase the property, P200,000.00 had come from the sale of palay harvested from the hacienda owned by Luis and P300,000.00 from the rentals of a building belonging to Rizza. In fine, the sum of P500,000.00 had been part of the fruits received during the period of cohabitation from their separate property. A car worth P100,000.00, being used by the common-law spouses, was donated just months ago to Rizza by her parents. Luis and Rizza now decide to terminate their cohabitation, and they ask you to give them your legal advice on the following: How, under the law, should the bank deposit of P200,000.00, the house and lot valued at P500,000.00 and the car worth P100,000.00 be allocated to them?",
        "Answer": "Art. 147, FC provides in part that when a man and a woman who are capacitated to marry each other, live exclusively with each other as husband and wife without the benefit of marriage or under a void marriage, their wages and salaries shall be owned by them through their work or industry shall be governed by the rules of co-ownership. In the absence of proof to the contrary, properties acquired while they lived together shall be presumed to have been obtained by their joint efforts, work or industry, and shall be owned by them in equal shares. A party who did not participate in the acquisition by the other party of any property shall be deemed to have contributed jointly in the acquisition thereof if the former's efforts consisted in the care and maintenance of the family and of the household.

In the absence of the foregoing documents, an illegitimate child may also prove his or her filiation by open and continuous possession of the status of an illegitimate child or any other means allowed by the Rules of Court like entries in family bible or act or declaration about pedigree.

They were born during the marriage of Conrado and Clarita, hence, are considered legitimate children of the said spouses. This status is conferred on them at birth by law. Under Philippine law, a person cannot have more than one natural filiation. The legitimate filiation of a person can be changed only if the legitimate father will successfully impugn such status. In the problem, therefore, the filiation of Alberto and Baldomero as the legitimate children of Conrado cannot be changed by their recognition by Edilberto as his illegitimate children. Before they can be conferred the status of Edilberto's illegitimate children, Conrado must first impugn their legitimacy. Since Conrado has not initiated any action to impugn their legitimacy, they continue to be the legitimate children of Conrado. They cannot be the illegitimate children of Edilberto at the same time. Not being the illegitimate children of Edilberto, they have no right to inherit from him."

        "Answer": "Under the facts stated, X and Y are legitimate children of B and G. E is the legitimate children of B and G. E is the legitimated child of B and G. F is the illegitimate child of B and C as legitimate children of B and C, X and Y have the following rights: 1) To bear the surnames of the father and the mother, in conformity with the provisions of the NCC on surnames; 2) To receive support from their parents, their ascendants, and in proper cases, their brothers and sisters, in conformity with the provisions of the FC on Support; and To be entitled to the legitime and other successional rights granted to them by the NCC. (Art. 174, FC) E is the legitimated child of B and G. Under Art. 177, FC, only children conceived and born outside of wedlock of parents who, at the time of the conception of the former, were not disqualified by any impediment to marry each other may be legitimated. E will have the same rights as X and Y. F is the illegitimate child of B and G. F has the right to use the surname of G, her mother, and is entitled to support as well as the legitime consisting of 1/2 of that of each of X, Y, and E. (Art. 176, FC)"

        "Question": "After finding out that his girlfriend Sandy was 4 months pregnant, Sancho married Sandy. Both were single and had never been in any serious relationship in the past. Prior to the marriage, they agreed in a marriage settlement that the regime of conjugal partnership of gains shall govern their property relations during marriage. Shortly after the marriage, their daughter, Shalimar, was born. Before they met and got married, Sancho purchased a parcel of land on installment, under a Contract of Sale, with the full purchase price payable in equal annual amortizations over a period of 10 years, with no down payment, and secured by a mortgage on the land. The full purchase price was PhP 1million, with interest at the rate of 6% per annum. After paying the fourth annual installment, Sancho and Sandy got married, and Sancho completed the payments in the subsequent years from his salary as an accountant. The previous payments were also paid out of his salary. During their marriage, Sandy also won PhP1million in the lottery and used it to purchase jewelry. When things didn't work out for the couple, they filed an action for declaration of nullity of their marriage based on the psychological incapacity of both of them. When the petition was granted, the parcel of land and the jewelry bought by Sandy were found to be the only properties of the couple. What is the filiation status of Shalimar?",
        "Answer": "Shalimar is a legitimate child. Children conceived or born before the judgment of absolute nullity of the marriage because of psychological incapacity under Art. 36 has become final and executory shall be considered legitimate. (Art. 54, FC) Since Shalimar was born before the judgment granting the petition for declaration of absolute nullity of marriage of Sancho and Sandy under Art. 36 became final and executory. Shalimar is a legitimate child."

        "Question": "In 1990, Monica was born during the marriage of her parents Anton and Steph. In 2024, Monica discovered that a certain Patrick signed as the father in her birth certificate. Monica looked for Patrick and was informed that he passed away a year earlier. Monica learned that Patrick was Steph's last boyfriend before she married Anton. Thereafter, Monica filed a complaint for partition of Patrick's estate. Monica claimed that she is the non-marital child of Patrick and Steph. Monica submitted her birth certificate where Patrick recognized her as his daughter. The heirs of Patrick opposed the complaint and argued that Monica is presumed the legitimate child of Anton and Steph pursuant to Article 164 of the Family Code which states that 'children conceived or born during the marriage of the parents are legitimate.' The heirs of Patrick also invoked the rule that only the father can impugn the legitimacy of the child. May Monica impugn her own legitimacy in an action for partition? Explain.",
        "Answer": "NO. Monica cannot impugn her own legitimacy in an action for partition. Legitimacy cannot be attacked collaterally but only in a direct action filed for that purpose. (Liyao v. Liyao, G.R. No. 138961, March 7, 2002; De Jesus v. Estate of Dizon, G.R. No. 142877, October 2, 2001) The law provides that only the husband, and in exceptional cases his heirs, can impugn the legitimacy of the child born to the wife. (Article 171, Family Code) Moreover, the law mandates that the action to impugn legitimacy shall be brought within one year from knowledge of birth or its recording in the civil register if the husband resides in the same city or municipality where the birth took place or was recorded, two years if he resides in a different city or municipality, and three years if he resides abroad. Based on the law, Monica is not the proper party to impugn her legitimacy and even if she were, the action filed after twenty-four years has clearly prescribed. (See Also - Santiago v. Jornacion, G.R. No. 230049, October 6, 2021; Yap v. Yap, G.R. No. 222259, October 17, 2022)"

While Andy was single at the time, Aimee was still in the process of securing a judicial declaration of nullity on her marriage to her ex-husband. Gianna's birth certificate, which was signed by both Andy and Aimee, registered the status of Gianna as 'legitimate,' her surname carrying that of Andy's and that her parents were married to each other. Assuming that Aimee is successful in declaring her former marriage void, and Andy and Aimee subsequently married each other, would Gianna be legitimated?",
        "Answer": "NO, Gianna will not be legitimated. While the court may have declared the marriage void ab initio and therefore, no marriage took place in the eyes of the law, Gianna will still not be legitimated. This is because at the time she was conceived and born her biological parents could not have validly married each other. For their marriage to be valid, the court must first declare the first marriage null and void. In the problem, Gianna was conceived and born before the court has decreed the nullity of her mother's previous marriage."

Under the Domestic Administrative Adoption and Alternative Child Care Act (R.A. No. 11642), the following are necessary to give their consent to the adoption: 1. the adoptee, if 10 years of age or over; 2. the biological parents of the child, if known, or the legal guardian, or the proper government instrumentality which has legal custody of the child, except in the case of a Filipino of legal age if, prior to the adoption, said person has been consistently considered and treated as their own child by the adopters for at least 3 years; 3. The legitimate and adopted children, 10 years of age or over, of the adopters, if any; 4. The illegitimate children, 10 years of age or over, of the adopter if living with said adopter or over whom the adopter exercises parental authority and the latter's spouse, if any; and (5) The spouse, if any, of the person adopting or to be adopted. (Sec. 23, R.A. 11642) Since Rex and Lea are legally separated, her consent is no longer necessary. Therefore, only the consent of the 14-year-old legitimate child, the 10-year-old illegitimate child and of the biological parents or legal guardian of the illegitimate child are needed for the adoption."

        "Answer": "IT DEPENDS. If Tom and Sarah have been residing in the Philippines for at least 3 years prior to the effectivity of R.A. No. 8552, the petition may be granted because the American husband is not qualified to adopt. While the petition for adoption was filed in 1990, it was considered refiled upon the effectivity of R.A. No. 8552, the Domestic Adoption Act of 1998. This is the law applicable, the petition being still pending with the lower court. Under the Act, Sarah and Tom must adopt jointly because they do not fall in any of the exceptions where one of them may adopt alone. When husband and wife must adopt jointly, the Supreme Court has held in a line of cases that both of them must be qualified to adopt. While Sarah, an alien, is qualified to adopt under Sec. 7(b)(1) of the Act for being a former Filipino citizen who seeks to adopt a relative within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity, Tom an alien, is not qualified because he is neither a former Filipino citizen, nor married to a Filipino. One of them not being qualified to adopt their petition has to be denied. However, if they have been residents of the Philippines three years prior to the effectivity of the Act and continues to reside here until the decree of adoption is entered, they are qualified to adopt the nephew of Sara under Sec. 7(b) thereof, and the petition may be granted."

        "Answer": "YES, the trial court was correct. At the time the positions for adoptions were filed, petitioner had already remarried.

At that time, their child, Amado, was only 18 months old. Lila and Christopher returned to the Philippines and settled in El Nido, Palawan. Christopher allegedly promised to give support to Amado in the amount of US$1,000 per month, but he never did. Subsequently, Christopher also settled in Cebu where he cohabited with another Filipino woman. When Lila learned of the whereabouts of Christopher, she filed a complaint against him for violation of the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act for his refusal to support Amado. Lila also invoked Article 195 of the Family Code, which provides for those who are obliged to support each other. She argued that notwithstanding their divorce, Christopher is not excused from complying with his obligation to support Amado. Is Lila correct in invoking Article 195 of the Family Code? Explain.",
        "Answer": "NO, Lila is not correct in invoking Art. 195 of the Family Code. While it is true that under Art. 195 of the Family Code, the father is obliged to support his legitimate and illegitimate children, the defendant here is a foreign citizen and he shall be governed by his own national law. The nationality principle under Art. 15 of the Civil Code in relation to the Family Code provisions on support applies only to Filipino citizens. By analogy, the same principle applies to foreigners in that they are governed by their national law with respect to their family rights and duties. In the case presented, Christopher being an American citizen shall be governed by his national law. Thus, as to whether he is obliged to give support to his child as well as the consequences of his failure to do so shall be governed by American law. However, if Christopher invokes his national law he has the burden of proving the same and if the foreign law involved is not properly pleaded and proved, our courts will presume that the foreign law is the same as our local or domestic or internal law which enforces the obligation of parents to support their children and penalizing the non-compliance therewith.

While Sofia stayed in the Philippines with the children, Semuel went abroad to work and became a naturalized German citizen. He met someone in Germany whom he wanted to marry. Semuel thereafter came home and filed a petition with the RTC for partition of the common properties acquired during his union with Sofia in the Philippines. The properties acquired during the union consisted of a house and lot in Cavite worth P2 million, and some personal properties, including cash in bank amounting to P1 million. All these properties were acquired using Semuel's salaries and wages since Sofia was a stay-at-home mother. In retaliation, Sofia filed an action, on behalf of their minor children, for support. Should Semuel be required to support the minor children?",
        "Answer": "YES, Semuel is required to support his three children even if they were all born outside of wedlock. Support is ordained not only between parents and their legitimate children and the legitimate and illegitimate children of the latter, but also between parents and their illegitimate children and the legitimate and illegitimate children of the latter. (Art. 195, FC) The support that Semuel has to provide comprises everything indispensable for sustenance, dwelling, clothing, medical attendance, education and transportation including the children's schooling or training for some profession, trade or vocation. (Art. 194, FC) Even if Semuel is already a German citizen and on the assumption that German law does not require the natural father to support his illegitimate children, his denial of financial support is considered a criminal offense under Philippine law (R.A. No. 9262). Since he currently in the Philippines, the territoriality principle in criminal law will apply to render him liable for violation of our law on violence against women and children.

Basha countered that she is able to take care of and provide for Kynan despite her meager income. Are there compelling reasons to deprive Basha of Kynan's custody? Explain.",
        "Answer": "There are no compelling reasons to deprive Basha of Kynan's custody. Kynan was born outside of wedlock and therefore he is illegitimate. Article 176 of the Family Code an illegitimate child shall be under the sole parental authority and custody of the mother. (Briones v. Miguel G.R. No. 156343; October 18, 2004) Moreover, Popoy's contention that Basha is unfit to have custody of the child is without merit because only the most compelling of reasons shall justify the court's awarding the custody of such a child to someone other than his mother, such as her unfitness to exercise sole parental authority. The following grounds have been considered ample justifications to deprive a mother of custody and parental authority: neglect, abandonment, unemployment and immorality, habitual drunkenness, drug addiction, maltreatment of the child, insanity and being sick with a communicable disease. (Perez v. Court of Appeals G.R. No. 118870 March 29, 1996) Here, the supposed lesbian relationship of Basha would not constitute a compelling reason to deprive her of custody of her child. Assuming that such constitutes moral dereliction, it will not have any effect upon the baby who is as yet unable to understand her situation."

After spending the night together, Billy got Anita pregnant. A year after giving birth to Marisol and despite the vehement opposition of Billy, Anita went back to her previous job in Empyrea to support her child. Anita was able to provide a house, a nanny, and other necessities for Marisol. Billy, however, insisted that Anita no longer needed to work if she and Marisol stayed with him as he could provide for them. Since Anita refused to live with Billy, the latter filed a petition for custody of Marisol. Anita contended that illegitimate children are automatically under the sole custody and parental authority of the mother. On the other hand, Billy alleged that Anita is unfit to take care of Marisol given her line of work. If you are the judge, how will you decide the petition? Explain.",
        "Answer": "If I were the judge, I will rule in favor of Anita. The Family Code provides that illegitimate children shall be under the sole parental authority of the mother. (Art. 176, NCC) In addition, under the maternal preference rule, no child below seven years of age shall be separated from the mother unless there are compelling reasons to do so. In the case presented, Marisol is obviously an illegitimate child as she was born outside of wedlock to Anita and Billy. The child is also below seven years of age since the facts state that Anita went back to her job one year after giving birth to Marisol and it was at this time that Billy filed the custody petition. While even an illegitimate child may be separated from its mother if there is a compelling reason to do so, the instant case does not reveal that Anita is unfit to have custody of Marisol just because she works as an entertainer at a men's club. The Supreme Court in one case ruled that only the most compelling reasons shall justify the court's awarding of custody to someone other than the mother such as neglect, abandonment, unemployment, immorality, habitual drunkenness, and drug abuse.

        "Answer": "In substitute parental authority, the parents lose their parental authority in favor of the substitute who acquires it to the exclusion of the parents. In special parental authority, the parents or anyone exercising parental authority does not lose parental authority. Those who are charged with special parental authority exercise such authority only during the time that the child is in their custody or supervision. Substitute parental authority displaces parental authority while special parental authority concurs with parental authority."

        "Question": "On 05 May 1989, 16-year-old Rozanno, who was issued a student permit, drove to school a car, a gift from his parents. On even date, as his class was scheduled to go on a field trip, his teacher requested him to accommodate in his car, as he did, four (4) of his classmates because the van rented by the school was too crowded. On the way to a museum which the students were scheduled to visit, Rozanno made a wrong maneuver, causing a collision with a jeepney. One of his classmates died. He and the three (3) others were badly injured. Who is liable for the death of Rozanno's classmate, and the injuries suffered by Rozanno and his 3 other classmates? Explain.",
        "Answer": "At the time the incident occurred in May 1989, Rozanno was still a minor. Being a minor, Art. 218, (FC) applies. Pursuant to Art. 218, the school, its administrators and teachers shall be liable for the acts of minor Rozanno because of the special parental authority and responsibility that they exercise over him. The authority applies to all authorized activities, whether inside or outside the premises of the school, entity or institution. The field trip on which occasion Rozanno drove the car, was an authorized activity, and, thus, covered by the provision. Furthermore, the parents of Rozanno are subsidiarily liable pursuant to Art. 219 of the FC, and principally liable under Art. 221 of the FC, if they are negligent."

On the way to a museum which the students were scheduled to visit, Rozanno made a wrong maneuver, causing a collision with a jeepney. One of his classmates died. He and the three (3) others were badly injured. Under the same facts, except the date of occurrence of the incident, this time in mid-1994, what would be your answer? Explain.",
        "Answer": "Since Rozanno was 16 years old in 1989, if the incident happened sometime in the middle of 1994, Rozanno have been 21 years old at the time. Hence, he was already of legal age. The law reducing the age of majority to 18 years took effect in December 1989. Being of legal age, Arts. 218, 219, and 221, FC are no longer applicable. In such case, only Rozanno will be personally responsible for all the consequences of his act unless his school or his parents were themselves also negligent and such negligence contributed to the happening of the incident. In that event, the school or his parents are not liable under Arts. 218, 218, or 221, FC, but will be liable under general provision of the NCC on quasi-delict."

        "Question": "If during class hours, while the teacher was chatting with other teachers in the school corridor, a 7-year-old male pupil stabs the eye of another boy with a ball pen during a fight, causing permanent blindness to the victim, who could be liable for damages for the boy's injury: the teacher, the school authorities, or the guilty boy's parents? Explain.",
        "Answer": "The school, its administrators, and teachers have special parental authority and responsibility over the minor child while under their supervision, instruction or custody. (Art. 218, FC) They are principally and solidarity liable for the damages caused by the acts or omissions of the unemancipated minor unless they exercised the proper diligence required under the circumstances. (Art. 219, FC) In the problem, the teacher and the school authorities are liable for the blindness of the victim, because the student who causes it was under their special parental authority and they were negligent. They were negligent because they were chatting in the corridor during the class period when the stabbing incident occurred. The incident could have been prevented had the teacher been inside the classroom at that time. The guilty boy's PARENTS are subsidiarily liable under Art. 219, FC."

Since she is the mother of the child that was born out of wedlock, she has exclusive parental authority and custody over the child. Gigolo, therefore, has no right to have custody of the child and his refusal to give up custody will constitute illegal detention for which habeas corpus is the proper remedy."

When Sara tried to pay her debt on the 8th month, Julia demanded the payment of interest of 12% per annum because of Sara's delay in payment. Sara paid her debt and the interest claimed by Julia. After rethinking, Sara demanded back from Julia the amount she had paid as interest. Julia claims she has no obligation to return the interest paid by Sara because it was a natural obligation which Sara voluntarily performed and can no longer recover. Do you agree? Explain.",
        "Answer": "NO. Under the Civil Code, natural obligations are those not based on positive law but on equity and natural law. (Art. 1423, NCC) The obligation in this case is based on positive law, particularly the provisions governing solutio indebiti or payment by mistake. (Art. 22, NCC) Applying the Civil Code, Sara has no demandable obligation to pay interest because no stipulation for the payment of such was made in writing. (Art. 1956, NCC) Thus, there was a payment by mistake made by Sara."

Following the pro reo doctrine, under Art. 48 of the Revised Penal Code, crimes are complexed and punished with a single penalty (i.e that prescribed for the most serious crime and to be imposed in its maximum period). The rationale being, that the accused who commits two crimes with single criminal impulse demonstrates lesser perversity than when the crimes are committed by different acts and several criminal resolutions. (People v. Comadre, 431 SCRA 366, 384 [2004}. However, Art. 48 shall be applied only when it would bring about the imposition of a penalty lesser than the penalties imposable for all the component crimes if prosecuted separately instead of being complexed."

While on board the vessel, he saw his mortal enemy Iason, also an Indonesian national, seated at the back portion of the cabin and who was busy reading a newspaper. Ando stealthily approached Iason and when he was near him, Ando stabbed and killed Iason. The vessel is registered in Malaysia. The killing happened just a few moments after the vessel left the port of Manila. Operatives from the PNP Maritime Command arrested Ando. Presented for the killing of Iason, Ando contended that he did not incur criminal liability because both he and the victim were Indonesians. He likewise argued that he could not be prosecuted in Manila because the vessel is a Malaysian-registered ship. Discuss the merits of Ando's contentions. ",
        "Answer": "Both contentions of Ando lack merit. The argument of Ando that he did not incur criminal liability because both he and the victim were Indonesians is not tenable. Under the generality principle, penal laws shall be obligatory upon all who live or sojourn in the Philippine territory (Article 14 of the Civil Code). The foreign characteristic of an offender and offended party does not exclude him from operation of penal laws (People v. Galacgac, C.A., 54 O.G. 1027). Under the Revised Penal Code, except as provided in treaties and laws of preferential application, penal laws of the Philippines shall have force and effect within its territory. Here, since the killing took place within the Philippine territory, our penal laws applies and Ando may be held criminally responsible despite his being and Indonesian citizen. Likewise, the contention of Ando that he could not be prosecuted in Manila because the vessel is a Malaysian- registered ship is without merit. Under the English Rule, which our jurisdiction recognizes and follows, crimes committed aboard a vessel within the territorial waters of a country are triable in the courts of such country except when crimes merely affect things within the vessel or when they only refer to the internal management thereof. Here, since the crime was committed within the Philippine waters and neither exception applies, Ando may be prosecuted in Manila. (ADDITIONAL ANSWER: Under Section 27 of the Convention of the Law of The Sea, the criminal jurisdiction of the coastal State should not be exercised on board a foreign ship passing through the territorial sea to arrest any person or to conduct any investigation in connection with any crime committed on board the ship during its passage except if the crime is of a kind to disturb the peace of the country or the good order of the territorial sea. The vessel is still within the territorial waters of the Philippines when the crime was committed since the killing happened a few moments after the vessel left the port of Manila. Murder committed by Ando disturbs the peace of the Philippines; hence, he could be prosecuted in Manila.)"

        "Answer": "Reporma may raise the limitations imposed by the 1987 Constitution on the power of Congress to enact retroactive penal laws which are prejudicial to the accused. Under the Bill of Rights of the Constitution such is classified as an ex post facto law. It should be noted that when Congress decriminalized the crime of subversion, under R.A. 7637, it obliterated the felony and its effects upon Reporma. Consequently charging him now under the new law for his previous membership in the Communist Party would be constitutionality impermissible."

        "Answer": "The constitutional provisions limiting the power of Congress to enact penal laws are the following: 1. The law must not be an ex post facto law or it should not be given a retroactive effect. 2. The law must not be a bill of attainder, meaning it cannot provide punishment without judicial process. 3. The law must not impose cruel, unusual or degrading punishment. 4. No person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law."

        "Question": "Assume that you are a member of the legal staff of Senator Salcedo who wants to file a bill about imprisonment at the National Penitentiary in Muntinlupa. He wants to make the State prison a revenue earner for the country through a law providing for premium accommodations for prisoners (other than those under maximum security status) whose wives are allowed conjugal weekend visits, and for those who want long-term premium accommodations. For conjugal weekenders, he plans to rent out rooms with hotel-like amenities at rates equivalent to those charged by 4-star hotels; for long-term occupants, he is prepared to offer room and board with special meals in air conditioned single-occupancy rooms, at rates equivalent to those charged by 3-star hotels. What advice will you give the Senator from the point of view of criminal law, taking into account the purpose of imprisonment (7%) and considerations of ethics and morality ? ",
        "Answer": "I would advise Senator Salcedo not to file the said bill. First, the bill is unconstitutional as it violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution. It will create economic inequality in our criminal justice system. Rich prisoners will enjoy better amenities and privileges than those who are poor. Second, the bill will defeat the purpose of penalties in criminal law, which is to secure justice, retribution, and reformation."

Enrique’s hideout was discovered by the police. Carla was rescued while Enrique was arrested. The prosecutor considered that the ransom note was never received... and filed a case of “Impossible crime to commit kidnapping” against Enrique. Is the prosecutor correct? If he is not correct, can he instead file a case of grave coercion? ",
        "Answer": "The Prosecutor is not correct. There is no “Impossible crime to commit kidnapping”. First, an impossible crime applies only to Crimes against Persons and Crimes against Property under Titles 8 and 10 of the RPC, respectively. Kidnapping is a Crime against Personal Liberty and Security under Title 9, RPC. Second, even if the ransom note was not received by Carla’s parents, the crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention for ransom is already consummated. Under Article 267, RPC, Kidnapping for Ransom is committed “when the kidnapping or detention is for the purpose of extorting ransom from the victim or any other person.” To consummate the crime, it suffices that the purpose is to extort ransom; it is not necessary that the ransom note be received or that ransom be paid. No, the Prosecutor cannot file a case of grave coercion because the crime committed, as explained above, is kidnapping for ransom."

Charlie would be, criminally liable for less serious physical injuries because his act of mixing the powder with Brad's food was done with felonious intent and was the proximate cause of Brad's illness for 10 days.

Delmo has performed all the acts of execution that would produce the death of the victim but for reasons independent of the will of the perpetrator, the death of the victim was not accomplished.

The spoke typically interacts with the hub rather than with another spoke. In the event that the spoke shares a common purpose to succeed; there is a single conspiracy. However, in the instances when each spoke is unconcerned with the success of the other spokes, there are multiple conspiracies.

The following are the differences between recidivism and habitual delinquency: RECIDIVISM: Nature of crime: First crime and the aggravated second crime are embraced in the same Title of the RPC. Time element: Accused was convicted of the first crime by final judgment at the time of the trial of the second crime. Number of crimes: At least two crimes committed. Nature of the aggravating circumstance: Ordinary aggravating circumstance the presence of any of which will trigger the application of the penalty for the second crime committed in its maximum period unless it is off-set by a mitigating circumstance. HABITUAL DELINQUENCY: Nature of crime: First, second and third crimes must be a habitual delinquency crime, that is, serious or less serious physical injuries, theft, robbery, estafa or falsification of document. Time element: The accused was convicted of first habitual delinquency crime; within ten years after conviction or release, he was found guilty or habitual-delinquency crime for the second time; within 10 years after conviction or release, he was found guilty of habitual-delinquency crime for the third time or oftener.

Nos. 138874-75, January 31, 2004). The mitigating circumstances of passion and voluntary surrender can be appreciated in favor of A. The aggravating circumstances of unlawful entry, by means of fire, and treachery can be appreciated against A, X, Y and Z."

His act of having carnal knowledge of Loretta against her will and with the use of force and violence constituted rape, plus the killing of Loretta by reason or on the occasion of the rape, gave rise to the special complex crime of rape with homicide.

The special complex crime of rape with homicide is constituted only when both the rape and the killing are consummated; when one or both of them are not consummated, they are to be charged and punished separately.

Imminent unlawful aggression means an attack that is impending or at the point of happening; it must not consist in a mere threatening attitude, nor must it be merely imaginary, but must be offensive and positively strong...

Pedro picked up a spade and hit the attacker on his head which caused the latter’s death. Can Pedro be absolved of the killing on the ground that it is in defense of a relative? Explain.  ",
        "Answer": "No. The relatives of the accused for purpose of defense of relative under Article 11 (2) of the Revised Penal Code are his spouse, ascendants, descendants, or legitimate, natural or adopted brothers or sisters, or of his relatives by affinity in the same degrees, and those by consanguinity within the fourth civil degree. Relative by affinity within the same degree includes the ascendant, descendant, brother or sister of the spouse of the accused. In this case, Juan is not the ascendant, descendant, brother or sister of Tessie, the spouse of Pedro. Relative by consanguinity within the fourth civil degree includes first cousin. But in this case Juan is the cousin of Pedro by affinity but not by consanguinity, Juan, therefore, is not a relative of Pedro for purpose of applying the provision on defense of relative. Pedro, however, can invoke defense of a stranger. Under the revised Penal Code, a person who defends a person who is not his relative may invoke the defense of a stranger provided that all its elements exist, to wit: (a) unlawful aggression, (b) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel the attack; and (c) the person defending be not induced by revenge, resentment, or other evil motive."

Fearing the onset of another violent fight, Julia stabbed Romeo while he was asleep... She asserted “battered woman’s syndrome” as her defense. Explain the “cycle of violence.”  ",
        "Answer": "The battered woman syndrome is characterized by the so-called “cycle of violence,” which has three phases: (1) the tension-building phase; (2) the acute battering incident; and (3) the tranquil, loving (or, at least, nonviolent) phase. During the tension-building phase, minor battering occurs-it could be verbal or slight physical abuse or another form of hostile behavior. The woman tries to pacify the batterer through a kind, nurturing behavior; or by simply staying out of his way. The acute battering incident is characterized by brutality, destructiveness and, sometimes, death. The battered woman deems this incident as unpredictable, yet also inevitable. During this phase, she has no control; only the batterer may put an end to the violence. The final phase of the cycle of violence begins when the acute battering incident ends.

Under Section 3 (c) of RA NO. 9262, “Battered Woman Syndrome” refers to a scientifically defined pattern of psychological and behavioral symptoms found in women living in battering relationships as a result of “cumulative abuse”. In this case, because of the battering episodes, Julia, feared the onset of another violent fight and honestly believed the need to defend herself even if Romeo had not commenced an unlawful aggression. Even in the absence of unlawful aggression, however, Battered Woman Syndrome is a defense.

        "Answer": "No, a single act of battery or physical harm committed by Dion against Talia resulting to the physical and psychological or emotional distress on her part is not sufficient to avail of the benefit of the justifying circumstance of “Battered Woman Syndrome”. The defense of Battered Woman Syndrome can be invoked if the woman with marital relationship with the victim is subjected to cumulative abuse or battery involving the infliction of physical harm resulting to the physical and psychological or emotional distress.

        "Answer": "Privileged mitigating circumstances are those that mitigate the criminal liability of the accused by graduating the imposable penalty for the crime being modified to one or two degrees lower. These circumstances cannot be offset by aggravating circumstance. The circumstance of incomplete justification or exemption (when majority of the conditions are present), and the circumstance of minority (if the child above 15 years of age acted with discernment) are privileged mitigating circumstance. The distinctions between ordinary and privileged mitigating circumstances are as follows: i. Under the rules for application of divisible penalties (RPC, Art. 64), the presence of a mitigating circumstance, if not off-set by aggravating circumstance, has the effect of applying the divisible penalty in its minimum period. Under the rules on graduation of penalty (RPC, Art. 68, 69), the presence of privileged mitigating circumstance has the effect of reducing the penalty one to two degrees lower; ii. Ordinary mitigating circumstances can be off-set by aggravating circumstances. Privileged mitigating circumstances are not subject to the off-set rule."

The court sentenced him to suffer an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of reclusion temporal, as maximum, and a fine of P500,000. Michael applied for probation but his application was denied because the probation law does not apply to drug offenders under R.A. 9165.

        "Question": "Bernardo was enraged by his conviction for robbery by Judge Samsonite despite insufficient evidence. Pending his appeal, Bernardo escaped in order to get even with Judge Samsonite. Bernardo learned that the judge regularly slept in his mistress’ house every weekend. Thus, he waited for the judge to arrive on Saturday evening at the house of his mistress. It was about 8:00 p.m. when Bernardo entered the house of the mistress. He found the judge and his mistress having coffee in the kitchen and engaging in small talk. Without warning, Bernardo stabbed the judge at least 20 times. The judge instantly died. Prosecuted and tried, Bernardo was convicted of direct assault with murder. Rule with reasons whether or not the conviction for direct assault with murder was justified, and whether or not the trial court should appreciate the following aggravating circumstances against Bernardo, to wit: (1) disregard of rank and age of the victim, who was 68 years old; (2) dwelling; (3) nighttime; (4) cruelty; and (5) quasi-recidivism. (10%) (2017 BAR EXAM)",
        "Answer": "The phrase on occasion of such performance used in Article 48 of RPC means by reason of the past performance of official duty because the purpose of the law is to allow them to discharge their duties without fear of being assaulted by reason thereof (People v. Renegado, G.R. No. L-27031, May 31, 1974). Attacking Judge Samsonite by reason of past performance of duty of convicting Bernardo based on his assessment of the evidences constitutes qualified direct assault (U.S. v. Garcia, G.R. No. 6820, October 16, 1911). Since the single act of attacking Judge Samsonite constitutes direct assault and murder qualified by the circumstance of treachery, the two shall be merged together to form a complex crime of direct assault with murder (People v. Estonilo, Jr., G.R. No. 201565, October 13, 2014; People v. Dural, G.R. No. No. 84921, June 8, 1993; People v. Riuorta, G.R. No. 57415, December 15, 1989). Disregard of rank, being inherent in direct assault, is absorbed. Disregard of age shall not be considered for lack of showing of intent to offend or insult the age of Judge Samsonite (People v. Onabia, G.R. No. 128288, April 20, 1999). Dwelling and nighttime shall not be appreciated because the presence of treachery in the instant case absorbs these aggravating circumstances. The crime is not aggravated by cruelty simply because Judge Samson sustained 10 stab wounds. For cruelty to be considered as an aggravating Circumstance, it must be proven that in inflicting several stab wounds on the victim, the perpetrator intended to exacerbate the pain and suffering of the victim. The number of wounds inflicted on the victim Is not proof of cruelty (Simangan v. People G.R. No. 157984 July 8, 2004). Unless there is a proof that when the 2nd or subsequent stabs were made, the Judge was still alive, there is no cruelty to speak of. A quasi-recidivist is a person who shall commit a felony after having been convicted by final judgment, before beginning to serve such sentence, or while serving the same (Article 160 of the Revised Penal Code). In this case, Bernardo committed the crime while the judgement of conviction is on appeal. Thus, quasi-recidivism cannot be considered since he did not commit the crime after having been convicted by final judgment."

Discuss the applicability of the relevant aggravating circumstances of dwelling, nocturnity and the use of the picklock to enter the room of the victim.  (2009 Bar Question)",
        "Answer": "Dwelling is aggravating because the crimes were committed in the privacy of Loretta's room which in law is considered as her dwelling. It is well settled that dwelling includes a room in a boarding house being occupied by the offended party where she enjoys privacy, peace of mind and sanctity of an abode. Nocturnity or nighttime is also aggravating because although it was not purposely or especially sought for by Wenceslao, nighttime was obviously taken advantaged of by him in committing the other crimes. Under the objective test, nocturnity is aggravating when taken advantaged of by the offender during the commission of the crime thus facilitating the same. The use of a picklock to enter the room of the victim is not an aggravating circumstance under Art. 14 of the Code but punished as a crime by itself where the offender has no lawful cause for possessing it. The use of picklocks is equivalent to force upon things in robbery with force upon things."

Already drunk, Mr. Red declared in a loud voice that if he could not have Ms. Yellow, no one can. He then proceeded to the men’s room but told Mr. White and Mr. Blue to take care of Mr. Green. Mr. Blue and Mr. White asked Mr. Red what he meant but Mr. Red simply said, You already know what I want, and then left. Mr. Blue and Mr. White proceeded to kill Mr. Green and hurt Ms. Yellow. What, if any, are the respective liabilities of Mr. Red, Mr. White and Mr. Blue for the death of Mr. Green? ",
        "Answer": "Mr. Blue and Mr. White are liable for the death of Mr. Green as principals by direct participation. They were the ones who participated in the criminal resolution and who carried out their plan and personally took part in its execution by acts which directly tended to the same end. Mr. Red cannot be held criminally liable as principal by inducement because his statement that Mr. Blue and Mr. White are to take care of Mr. Green was not made directly with the intention of procuring the commission of the crime. There is no showing that the words uttered by him may be considered as so efficacious and powerful so as to amount to physical or moral coercion (People v. Assad, G.R. No. L-33673, February 24, 1931). Neither is there evidence to show that Mr. Red has an ascendancy or influence over Mr. White and Mr. Blue (People v. Abarri, F.R. No. 90815, March 1, 1995)."

        "Question": "Modesto and Abelardo are brothers. Sometime in August 1998 while Abelardo was in his office, Modesto, together with two other men in police uniform, came with two heavy bags. Modesto asked Abelardo to keep the two bags in his vault until he comes back to get them. When Abelardo later examined the two bags, he saw bundles of money that, in his rough count, could not be less than P5 Million. He kept the money inside the vault and soon he heard the news that a gang that included Modesto had been engaged in bank robberies. Abelardo, unsure of what to do under the circumstances, kept quiet about the two bags in his vault. Soon after, the police captured, and secured a confession from, Modesto who admitted that their loot had been deposited with Abelardo. What is Abelardo's liability? ",
        "Answer": "Abelardo is not criminally liable. To be criminally liable as an accessory under Art. 19, such person must have knowledge of the commission of the crime. The term “knowledge “under the law is not synonymous with suspicion. Mere suspicion that the crime has been committed is not sufficient. Even if he can be considered as an accessory under Art. 19(2) of RPC, Abelardo is not liable, being the brother of Modesto under Art. 20, RPC."

",
        "Answer": "Accomplice: Knowledge of the criminal design of the principal need not be shown to prove complicity, although the offender must be aware of the principal’s intention; Participation consists of previous or simultaneous acts that are not indispensable to the commission of the crime; Penalty is one degree lower than the penalty prescribed by law for the principal; Elements to be established are: (1) that the principal committed a felony; (2) that the accused cooperated in the execution of the crime by previous or simultaneous acts; and (3) that the cooperation was not indispensable.

        "Question": "Nel learned that Elgar, the owner of the biggest house in the place, would be out of town for three days with no one left to watch the house. He called his friends Ben, Ardo and Gorio and they planned to take the valuables in the house while Elgar was away. Nel and Ben would go inside the house, Ardo would serve as the lookout, while Gorio would stay in the getaway car. When Elgar left, they carried out their plan to the letter. Nel and Ben went inside the house through the backdoor which was left unlocked. None of the rooms and drawers inside were locked. They took the money, jewelry and other valuables therefrom and immediately left using the getaway car. After driving for about one kilometer, Nel realized he left his bag and wallet with IDs in the house and so he instructed Gorio to drive back to the house. Nel just went in thinking that the house was still empty. But to his surprise, Nel found Fermin seated on a bench with Nel's bag and wallet beside him and appeared to be texting using his smart phone. Nel took a golf club near him and hit Fermin with it. Fermin shouted for help, but Nel kept hitting him until he stopped making noise. The noise alerted the neighbor who called the police. Nel, Ben, Ardo and Gorio were caught. Fermin died. What is the criminal liability of Nel, Ben, Ardo and Gorio? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Nel, Ben, Ardo and Gorio are criminally liable as principals for the crime of Theft. They conspired to take Elgar’s personal properties without his knowledge, with intent to gain, and without violence against or intimidation of persons or force upon things (Art. 308, RPC). Nel and Ben are liable as principals by direct participation while Ardo and Gorio are principals by indispensable cooperation because they have concurred in the criminal resolution and cooperated by performing another act as lookout and driver of a getaway car, respectively, which were indispensable for the commission of the crime (Art. 17, RPC). Nel, however, is also liable for the separate crime of Homicide for the death of Fermin. The killing of Fermin was a separate act and was not a necessary means for committing Theft (Art. 48, RPC) because the latter crime was already consummated. Nel killed Fermin for a different reason perhaps because of his anger that Fermin was in possession of his bag and wallet and appeared to be using his smart phone to contact the police."

        "Question": "To secure a release of his brother Willy, a detention prisoner, and his cousin Vincent, who is serving sentence for homicide, Chito asked the RTC Branch Clerk of Court to issue an Order which would allow the two prisoners to be brought out of jail. At first, the Clerk refused, but when Chita gave her P50,000.00, she consented. She then prepared an Order requiring the appearance in court of Willy and Vincent, ostensibly as witnesses in a pending case. She forged the judge's signature, and delivered the Order to the jail warden who, in turn, allowed Willy and Vincent to go out of jail in the company of an armed escort, Edwin. Chito also gave Edwin P50,000.00 to leave the two inmates unguarded for three minutes and provide them with an opportunity to escape. Thus, Willy and Vincent were able to escape. What crime or crimes, if any, had been committed by Chito, the Branch Clerk of court, and Edwin? Explain your answer.  (2009 Bar Question)",
        "Answer": "The crimes committed in this case are as follows: Chito committed the crimes of -1. Delivery of Prisoners from Jail (Art. 156, RPC) for working out the escape of prisoners Willy and Vincent; 2. Two counts of Corruption of Public Officials (Art. 212, RPC); and 3. Falsification of Public Documents, as a principal by inducement (Art. 172, RPC). The Branch Clerk of Court committed the crimes of: 1. Direct Bribery (Art. 210, RPC) for accepting the P50,000.00 - in consideration of the order she issued to enable the prisoners to get out of jail; 2. Falsification of Public Document for forging the judge's signature on said Order (Art. 171, RPC); 3. Delivery of Prisoners from Jail (Art. 156, RPC), as a co-principal of Chito by indispensable cooperation for making the false Order and forging the judge's signature thereon, to enable the prisoners to get out of jail; 4. Evasion of Service of Sentence (Art. 157, RPC); as a co-principal of Vincent by indispensable cooperation for making the false Order that enabled Vincent to evade service of his sentence; Edwin, the jail guard who escorted the prisoners in getting out of jail, committed the crimes of – 1. Infidelity in the Custody of Prisoners, specifically conniving with or consenting to Evasion for leaving unguarded the prisoners escorted by him and provide them an opportunity to escape (Art. 223, RPC); 2. Direct Bribery for receiving the P50,000.00 as consideration for leaving the prisoners unguarded and allowing them the opportunity to escape (Art. 210, RPC)."

        "Answer": "Ruben's liability is that of an accomplice only because he merely cooperated in Ponciano's determination to kill Freddie. Such cooperation is not indispensable to the killing, as in fact the killing was carried out without the use of Ruben's gun.

If crime is punishable under the RPC, the court shall sentence the accused to an indeterminate sentence the maximum term of which shall be that which, in view of the attending circumstance, could be properly imposed under the rules of the said Code, and the minimum of which shall be within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by the Code for the offense.

        "Question": "Two informations were filed against Solito in the RTC – one for forcible abduction with rape... the other for illegal sale of drugs... Was Solito charged with the proper offenses based on the circumstances? Explain your answer.  (2017 BAR EXAM)",
        "Answer": "The charge of rape through forcible abduction is correct. The rule is settled that if the main objective of the accused is to rape the victim, the crime is rape even if he abducted for her forcefully. Forcible abduction is absorbed. The doctrine of absorption rather than Article 48 of RPC is applicable since forcible abduction is an indispensable is an indispensable means to commit rape... If forcible abduction, however, is a necessary means to commit rape, this is a complex crime proper under Article 48 of RPC."

        "Question": "While the Prosecution was presenting its evidence in Branch 29 (illegal sale of drugs), Branch 8 (forcible abduction with rape) convicted Solito. Immediately after the judgment of conviction was promulgated, Solito filed in both Branches a motion for the release of the Toyota Innova. He argued and proved that he had only borrowed the vehicle from his brother, the registered owner. Branch 8 granted the motion but Branch 29 denied it. Were the two courts correct in their rulings? Explain your answer.  (2017 BAR EXAM)",
        "Answer": "Yes. The two courts were correct in their rulings. Under Article 45 of the Revised Penal Code... every penalty imposed for the commission of a felony shall include the forfeiture of the instruments or tools with which the crime was committed, unless they be the property of a third person not liable for the offense... Hence, the determination of whether it will be forfeited could be made only when judgment is rendered. In this case, the RTC Branch 8 already rendered a judgment of conviction against Solito... Solito was able to prove that the car belonged to his brother who was not charged with forcible abduction with rape; hence, it was correct for the RTC branch 8 to order the release... On the other hand, Section 20 of R.A. No. 9165 states in part... no property... which may be confiscated and forfeited, shall be disposed... while the trial is still ongoing... The RTC Branch 29, thus was correct in denying Solito’s motion to release the Toyota Innova considering that the trial for illegal sale of drugs is still ongoing."

There is no crime of frustrated serious physical injuries because the existence of intent to commit serious physical injuries is negated by the gravity of the resulting physical injuries. If the physical injuries sustained are serious, the crime is consummated serious physical injuries. If the injury sustained is slight, the crime is slight physical injuries. If the injury sustained is physical injury not covered by serious and slight physical injuries, the crime is less serious physical injuries."

        "Question": "A criminal complaint for attempted rape with homicide was brought against Aliswan... the Investigating Prosecutor recommended the filing of two separate informations – one for attempted rape and the other for homicide. Do you agree with the recommendation? Explain your answer.  (2017 BAR EXAM)",
        "Answer": "I do not agree with the recommendation for the filing or attempted rape. Intent to have sexual Intercourse is an essential element of attempted rape. In other words, intent to lie with the victim must be closer. However, this intent is not established for failure to show that Aliswan had done acts to have sex with Amethyst... Moreover, he spontaneously desisted from committing further lascivious acts after undressing Amethyst which is a defense in attempted rape. Undressing the victim with lewd design merely constitutes acts of lasciviousness."

        "Answer": "The proper charge against Amante is Child Abuse. His act of physically harming the child, Alisto, which resulted to an injury requiring medical attendance for 10 days, is considered physical abuse under Sec. 10 (a), in relation to Sec. 3(b)(2), of R.A.

Is Art. 247 (death or physical injuries inflicted under exceptional circumstances) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) applicable in this case given that the paramour was of the same gender as the erring spouse?  ",
        "Answer": "No. Art. 247 of the Revised Penal Code is not applicable. Under the Revised Penal Code, for Art. 247 to apply, the offender must catch his or her spouse in the act of committing sexual intercourse with another person. Sexual intercourse generally presupposes the penetration of the man’s sexual organ into that of a woman’s. In this case, the paramour was of the same gender as the erring spouse. As such, there is legally, no sexual intercourse to speak of, hence, Art. 247 is not applicable."

Buwaya,' 'magnanakaw,' and 'kurakot.' The three defendants argued that the article is within the ambit of qualified privileged communication; that there is no malice in law and in fact; and, that defamatory comments on the acts of public officials... do not constitute libel. Was the crime of libel committed? If so, are A, B, and C all liable for the crime? Explain.  ",
        "Answer": "Yes. The crime of libel is committed. Fair comment on acts of public officers related to the discharge of their duties is a qualified privileged communication, hence, the accused can still be held liable for libel if actual malice is shown. In fair comment, actual malice can be established by showing that comment was made with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not. The report made by C describing a lawyer in the Bureau of Customs as corrupt cannot be considered as “fair” and “true” since he did not do research before making his allegations, and it has been shown that these allegations were baseless... A, B and C are all liable as principals since the RPC holds the author, editor, and the publisher liable as principals."

Gagging the mouth of the child with stockings, placing him in a box, sealing it with masking tape, and placed the box in the attic were only methods employed by the defendant in committing: murder qualified by the circumstance of treachery. Taking advantage of the defenseless condition of the victim by reason of his tender age in killing him is treachery...

        "Answer": "Guapo and Pogi cannot be held liable for the death of Pretty due to suicide committed by reason of the rapes. Suicide is an intervening cause that breaks the connection between the rapes and death. The death resulting from suicide cannot be considered as the direct, natural and logical consequence of the rapes committed by Guapo and Pogi."

Since Sexy was raped for two weeks, there was a clear deprivation of liberty, which constitutes the crime of kidnapping with serious illegal detention... Since as a consequence of the detention, the victim is raped, the crime committed is special complex crime of kidnapping with rape, the resultant crime is only one kidnapping with rape."

What crime or crimes, if any, did Leoncio commit? Explain.  (2009 Bar Question)",

The act of dipping his private parts in Evelyn's buttocks during a very seductive dance, although offensive to Evelyn, may be viewed as part of a dirty dancing... The fact that the act was perpetrated in a public place and with an audience, negates lewd designs or lascivious intent, which is essential in the crime of acts of lasciviousness."

        "Answer": "The crime would then be acts of lasciviousness. That the music for dancing had already stopped, puts an end to any pretense of dancing by Leoncio. His continued dirty acts absent the dancing as there was no music anymore is patently lewd and lascivious. More so, Evelyn already protested Leoncio's lewd acts in the course of dancing.

Two days before maturity, Frank called Eric telling him he had insufficient funds and requested that the deposit of the check be deferred. Nevertheless, Eric deposited the check and it was dishonored. When Frank failed to pay despite demand, Eric filed a complaint against him for violation of Batas Pambansa Big. 22 (The Bouncing Checks Law). Was the charge brought against Frank correct? ",
        "Answer": "Yes, the charge brought against Frank is correct. Violation of B.P. 22 is malum prohibitum which is committed by mere issuance of a check. Good faith is not a defense... For this reason, the request of Frank to defer the deposit of the check as it has insufficient funds will not militate against his prosecution for B.P. 22. Despite notice, Frank can still be charged. Moreover, if what is charged is Estafa, Frank, being a brother of the offended party, cannot be held criminally liable under Art. 332, RPC."

Elen was charged with estafa and violation of Batas Pambansa Big. 22. Will the charges against Elen prosper? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Yes, the charges will prosper. Elen is liable for Estafa through Misappropriation (Art. 315 par. 1(b), RPC) because her failure to remit the proceeds or return the jewelry within 60 days gives rise to the presumption of misappropriation. She is also liable for violation of BP 22 for issuing bouncing checks on account or for value and with knowledge that her funds were insufficient... The crime of estafa was already consummated when the 60-day period expired without Elen accounting for the items."

Failure to prove that Ofelia knows; or should have known that the jewelry is stolen, therefore, is not a defense since this element is presumed to be present under Section 5 because Ofelia is in possession of this stolen property.

If you were the prosecutor, would you or would you not charge Roberto with a crime? ",
        "Answer": "I will charge Roberto with violation of Anti-Fencing Law. In this case, someone carnapped the vehicle, sold it to Roberto who did not take part in the crime. Roberto should have known also that the car was stolen because it was not properly documented as the deed of sale and registration certificate did not reflect the correct numbers of the vehicle’s engine and chassis. Apparently, he made no effort to check the papers covering his purchase.

Thus, for a charge of fencing to prosper, it must first be proven that the goods or items found in the possession of the accused were the proceeds of theft or robbery, the corpus delicti of fencing.

A cannot be held liable under BP 22 because he was a mere endorser of B’s check to C who exchanged the check with cash. BP22 does not apply to endorser of checks.

Ando stealthily approached lason and when he was near him, Ando stabbed and killed lason. The vessel is registered in Malaysia. The killing happened just a few moments after the vessel left the port of Manila. Operatives from the PNP Maritime Command arrested Ando. Presented for the killing of lason, Ando contended that he did not incur criminal liability because both he and the victim were Indonesians. He likewise argued that he could not be prosecuted in Manila because the vessel is a Malaysian-registered ship. Discuss the merits of Ando’s contentions. ",
        "Answer": "Both contentions of Ando lack merit. Under the generality principle, penal laws shall be obligatory upon all who live or sojourn in the Philippine territory. The foreign characteristic of an offender and offended party does not exclude him from operation of penal laws. Under the Revised Penal Code, except as provided in treaties and laws of preferential application, penal laws of the Philippines shall have force and effect within its territory. Here, since the killing took place within the Philippine territory, our penal laws applies and Ando may be held criminally responsible despite his being an Indonesian citizen. Likewise, the contention of Ando that he could not be prosecuted in Manila because the vessel is a Malaysian-registered ship is without merit. Under the English Rule, crimes committed aboard a vessel within the territorial waters of a country are triable in the courts of such country except when crimes merely affect things within the vessel or when they only refer to the internal management thereof. Here, since the crime was committed within the Philippine waters and neither exception applies, Ando may be prosecuted in Manila."

(B) Would your answer be the same if, as a result of the mixture, Pula got an upset stomach and had to be hospitalized for 10 days?",
        "Answer": "(A) Puti committed the impossible crime of murder. All the elements of an impossible crime are present. Puti’s act of mixing a solution with Pula’s food would have been murder, a crime against persons. The act was done with evil intent which is to kill Pula.

However, before the ransom note could be received by Carla’s parents, Enrique’s hideout was discovered by the police. Carla was rescued while Enrique was arrested. The prosecutor considered that the ransom note was never received by Carla’s parents and filed a case of 'Impossible crime to commit kidnapping' against Enrique. Is the prosecutor correct? If he is not correct, can he instead file a case of grave coercion? ",
        "Answer": "The Prosecutor is not correct. There is no 'Impossible crime to commit kidnapping'. First, an impossible crime applies only to Crimes against Persons and Crimes against Property under Titles 8 and 10 of the RPC, respectively. Kidnapping is a Crime against Personal Liberty and Security under Title 9, RPC. Second, even if the ransom note was not received by Carla’s parents, the crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention for ransom is already consummated. Under Article 267, RPC, Kidnapping for Ransom is committed 'when the kidnapping or detention is for the purpose of extorting ransom from the victim or any other person.' To consummate the crime, it suffices that the purpose is to extort ransom; it is not necessary that the ransom note be received or that ransom be paid. No, the Prosecutor cannot file a case of grave coercion because the crime committed, as explained above, is kidnapping for ransom."

His act of mixing the non-toxic powder with Brad’s food, done with intent to kill, would have constituted murder which is a crime against persons, had it not been for the employment of a means which, unknown to him, is ineffectual (Art.4, par. 2, RPC). [b] No, the answer would not be the same. Charlie would be, criminally liable for less serious physical injuries because his act of mixing the powder with Brad’s food was done with felonious intent and was the proximate cause of Brad’s illness for 10 days. It cannot constitute attempted murder, although done with intent to kill, because the means employed is inherently ineffectual to cause death and the crime committed must be directly linked to the means employed, not to the intent.

AA is a recidivist because she was previously convicted of theft in 2002, which is a crime embraced in the same title (Title 10) as the present crime of theft. The judge may also appreciate habitual delinquency if AA was convicted of theft or estafa at least twice before within 10 years from release or last conviction. However, frustrated homicide is not among the crimes enumerated for habitual delinquency."

Rape is now a crime against persons and, like the crime of homicide, is embraced in the same Title of the Revised Penal Code under which Amado had been previously convicted by final judgment. The absolute pardon granted to Amado did not obliterate the fact of his previous conviction for purposes of recidivism."

Angelo issued 500 separate checks to the 500 investors, all of which were dishonored. The investors filed 500 separate complaints for estafa against Angelo. Angelo moved to consolidate the 500 cases into one case, contending that all the 500 acts of estafa constitute a single or continuing crime of estafa. [a] What is delito continuado?  (2009 Bar Question) [b] Is Angelo’s contention tenable? Explain. (4%) (2009 Bar Question)",
        "Answer": "[a] Delito continuado refers to a crime constituted by several overt acts committed by the offender in one place, at about the same time, and all such overt acts violate one and the same provision of penal law, thus demonstrating that all such acts are the product of a single indivisible criminal resolution. [b] No. His contention is not tenable. The 500 acts of estafa do not constitute a single or continuing crime of estafa. Each act of issuing a check to each investor constitutes a separate crime of estafa. The fact that the checks were issued at about the same time and in one place does not make it a continuing crime because each act of estafa is a complete crime in itself, affecting different victims."

Pedro, Pablito and Juan are liable for robbery by band. They cannot be held liable for robbery with rape because they had no participation in the rape committed by Julio.

Porthos fell and was rushed to the hospital. He survived after a long confinement. (a) What are the kinds of unlawful aggression, and which kind was displayed in this case? Explain your answer.  (b) Standing trial for frustrated murder, Aramis pleaded self- defense. The Prosecution’s contention was that the plea of self- defense applied only to consummated killings. Rule, with explanations, on the tenability of Aramis’ claim of self-defense, and on the Prosecution’s contention.  (c) Porthos insisted that the element of treachery was present. To rule out treachery, Aramis asserted that both he and Porthos were then facing and confronting each other when he fired the shot. Rule, with reasons, on the respective contentions.  (2017 BAR EXAM)",
        "Answer": "(a) Unlawful aggression is of two kinds: (a) actual or material unlawful aggression; and (b) imminent unlawful aggression. Actual unlawful aggression is an attack or assault that is happening or is in progress. Imminent unlawful aggression is an attack that is about to happen. In this case, there is neither actual nor imminent unlawful aggression. Porthos was merely alighting from his vehicle, which does not constitute an attack. (b) The prosecution’s contention is not tenable. Self-defense can be invoked in frustrated or attempted homicide or murder. The stage of the felony does not affect the availability of self-defense. However, Aramis’ claim of self-defense is not tenable because there was no unlawful aggression on the part of Porthos. (c) There is no treachery as the attack was preceded by heated words. Treachery requires that the means of execution give the victim no opportunity to defend himself. Here, since both were facing each other, there was opportunity for defense, so treachery is absent."

Can Pedro be absolved of the killing on the ground that it is in defense of a relative? Explain.  ",

Juan, being the first cousin of Tessie, is within the fourth civil degree by affinity, but the defense of relative requires that the relative being defended must be within the degrees mentioned. However, Juan is not a relative of Pedro by consanguinity or affinity within the covered degrees. First cousins are within the fourth civil degree by consanguinity, but for defense of relative, it includes relatives by affinity only in the same degrees as consanguinity.

        "Question": "What is the foundation of the agrarian reform program under the 1987 Constitution? Who are the direct beneficiaries of the program?",
        "Answer": "The 1987 Constitution enunciates in Article II as one of the state policies that '(t)he State shall promote comprehensive rural development and agrarian reform. In Article XII of the Constitution, in dealing with the national economy and patrimony, it is also stated that (t)he State shall promote industrialization and full employment based on sound agricultural development and agrarian reform, x x x Then in Article XIII of the Constitution, in dealing with social justice and human rights, there is this provision, among others- 'The State shall, by law, undertake an agrarian reform program founded on the right of farmers and regular farm-workers, who are landless, to own directly or collectively the lands they till or in the case of other farmworkers, to receive a just share of the fruits thereof. To this end. the State shall encourage and undertake the just distribution of all agricultural lands, subject to such priorities and reasonable retention limits as the Congress may prescribe, taking into account ecological, developmental, or equity considerations, and subject to the payment of just compensation. In determining the retention limits, the State shall respect the right of small landowners. The State shall further provide incentives for voluntary landsharing. Taken togetner, the above provisions could be considered as the foundation of the agrarian reform program. Under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, the lands covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program shall be distributed as much as possible to landless residents of the same barangay. or in the absence thereof, landless residents of the same municipality in the following order of priority."

        "Question": "Is there any distinction between labor legislation and social legislation?",
        "Answer": "Labor legislation is sometimes distinguished from social legislation by the former referring to labor statutes, like Labor Relations Law and Labor Standards, and the latter to Social Security Laws. Labor legislation focuses on the rights of the worker in the workplace. Social legislation is a broad term and may include not only laws that give social security protection, but also those that help the worker secure housing and basic necessities. The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform law could also be considered a social legislation. ALTERNATIVE ANSWER: Yes. Labor Legislation is limited in scope, and deals basically with the rights and duties of employees and employers. Social Legislation is more encompassing and includes such subjects as agrarian relations, housing and human settlement, protection of women and children, etc. All labor laws are social legislation, but not all social legislation is labor law."

In the illegal dismissal case instituted by Clarito, the Labor Arbiter, citing Article 4 of the Labor Code, ruled in favor of Clarito upon finding Juan’s testimony doubtful. On appeal, the NLRC reversed the Labor Arbiter holding that Article 4 applies only when the doubt involves 'implementation and interpretation' of the Labor Code provisions. The NLRC explained that the doubt may not necessarily be resolved in favor of labor since this case involves the application of the Rules on Evidence, not the Labor Code. Is the NLRC correct? Reasons.  (2009 Bar Question)",
        "Answer": "The NLRC is not correct. It is a well settled doctrine that if doubts exist between the evidence presented by the employer and the employee, the scale of justice must be tilted in favor of the latter. It is a time honored rule that in controversies between laborer and master, doubts necessarily arising from the evidence, or in the implementation of the agreement and writing should be resolved in favor of the laborer. ANOTHER SUGGESTED ANSWER: No, the NLRC is not correct. Art. 221 of the Labor Code read: 'In any proceeding before the Commission....the rules of evidence prevailing in Courts of law....shall not be controlling and it is the spirit and intention of this Code that the Commission and its members and the Labor Arbiters shall use every and reasonable means to ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively without regard to technicalities of law and procedure, all in the interest of due process.'

Thus, an employer's management prerogative includes the right to terminate the services of an employee but this management prerogative is limited by the Labor Code which provides that the employer can terminate an employee only for a just cause or when authorized by law.

        "Question": "In her State of the Nation Address, the President stressed the need to provide an investor-friendly business environment so that the country can compete in the global economy that now suffers from a crisis bordering on recession. Responding to the call, Congress passed two innovative legislative measures, namely: (1) a law abolishing the security of tenure clause in the Labor Code; and (2) a law allowing contractualization in all areas needed in the employer’s business operations. However, to soften the impact of these new measures, the law requires that all employers shall obtain mandatory unemployment insurance coverage for all their employees. The constitutionality of the two (2) laws is challenged in court. As judge, how will you rule?  (2009 Bar Question)",
        "Answer": "The first innovative measure, on abolition of the security of tenure clause in the Labor Code, is unconstitutional as it goes against the entitlement of workers to security of tenure under Section 3, Article XIII of the 1987 Constitution. The second innovative measure, on a law allowing contractualization in all areas needed in the employer’s business operations, is legal. Article 106 of the Labor Code already allows the Secretary of Labor and Employment not to make appropriate distinction between labor-only and job contracting. This means that the Secretary may decide, through implementing regulation, not to prohibit labor-only contacting, which is an arrangement where the person supplying workers to an employer does not have substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, and the workers recruited and place by such person are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business of the employer. Hence, it would be legal for Congress to do away with the prohibition on labor-only contracting and allow contractualization in all areas needed in the employer’s business operations.

Court of Appeals (514 SCRA 522 ), provided the following guideposts in determining the validity of such release, waivers and quitclaims: 'Not all waivers and quitclaims are invalid as against public policy. If the agreement was voluntarily entered into and represents a reasonable settlement, it is binding on the parties and may not later be disowned simply because of a change of mind.

        "Question": "Procopio was dismissed from employment for stealing his co-employee Raul's watch. Procopio filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. The Labor Arbiter ruled in Procopio's favor on the ground that Raul's testimony was doubtful, and, therefore, the doubt should be resolved in favor of Procopio. On appeal, the NLRC reversed the ruling because Article 4 of the Labor Code - which states that all doubts in the interpretation and implementation of the provisions of the Labor Code, including the implementing rules and regulations, shall be resolved in favor of labor - applied only when the doubt involved the implementation and interpretation of the Labor Code; hence, the doubt, which involved the application of the rules on evidence, not the Labor Code, could not necessarily be resolved in favor of Procopio. Was the reversal correct? Explain your answer.  (2017 Bar Question)",
        "Answer": "The reversal is not correct. Article 227 (221) of the Labor Code clearly provides that the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law shall not be controlling in any proceeding before the NLRC or the Labor Arbiters. Moreover, the NLRC/Labor Arbiters are mandated to use every and all reasonable means to ascertain the facts speedily and objectively and without regard to technicalities of law or procedure, all in the interest of due process."

        "Answer": "Labor laws show solicitous compassionate policy towards the working man by providing that all doubts in the implementation and interpretation of labor laws including its implementing rules and regulations shall be resolved in favor of labor. Thus, among others, the Constitution recognizes that workers are entitled to security of tenure, humane conditions of work and a living wage. Labor laws should be liberally interpreted to ensure that the above rights are given to workers. Many times, an employee commits an offense that is a valid ground for disciplinary action but law and jurisprudence do not automatically provide for the termination of the guilty employee because termination may be too harsh a penalty, his employment may, more often than not be the sole source of his means of livelihood.

        "Answer": "Tripartism in labor relations is the policy of the State enunciated in the Labor Code (in Art. 275) which is implemented by consulting with representatives of workers and employers in the consideration and adoption of voluntary codes of principles designed to promote industrial peace ba.sed on social justice or to align labor movement relations with priorities in economic and social development. The codes of principles adopted at tripatite conferences are voluntary. They do not have a legal binding effect on workers and employers. But because these codes are considered and adopted by representatives of workers and employers, they are likely to be complied with voluntarily by workers and employers. ALTERNATIVE ANSWER: Should not bind unions and employers’ organizations that were not represented in the tripartite conference because they were not parties or signatories to any agreement arrived at in the conference."

For one reason or another, Salvacion did not get the job and filed a complaint with the POEA.

May Marino, Eddie and Jose be prosecuted? If so, for what specific offense/s?",
        "Answer": "Marino Eddie and Jose can be prosecuted. Recruitment and placement by persons without a license or authority constitute illegal activities. Marino, Eddie and Jose were engaged in recruitment and placement when they advertised that 20 teachers were wanted to Egypt. Advertising for employment is one of the acts considered as recruitment and placement in the Labor Code. That they were not engaged in recruitment and placement for profit does not mean that the conditions for a person to engage in recruitment and placement found in the Labor Code are not applicable to them. The Code applies to any recruitment or placement, whether for profit or not. The fact that only one prospective worker was involved does not mean that they were not engaged in recruitment or placement. They were. The reference in the Code that any person who offers employment to 'two or more persons' as being engaged in recruitment and placement does not mean that there must be at least two persons involved.

Are the above provisions of the contract of employment in conformity with, or violative of, the law?",
        "Answer": "Except for the provision that Danilo shall have time off with pay when the company's executives using the cars do not need Danilo's service for more than eight hours a day, in lieu of overtime, the provisions of the contract of employment of Danilo are not violative of any labor law because they instead improve upon the present provisions of pertinent labor laws. Thus, the monthly rate equivalent to 35 times the daily wage may be sufficient to include overtime pay. There is no labor law requiring the payment of sick and vacation leaves except the provision for a five-day service incentive leave in the Labor Code. The 5-day-leave with pay every month has no counterpart in Labor Law and is very generous. As for the provision in Danilo's contract of employment that he shall receive time off with pay in lieu of overtime, this violates the provision of the Labor Code which states that undertime work on any particular day shall not be offset by overtime work on any other day.

In May 1993, he was discharged and correspondingly paid vacation pay, terminal pay and overtime pay for the number of hours he actually rendered service in excess of his eight (8) working hours a day. Pedro Sisid, however, is dissatisfied with his overtime pay contending that he is on board the vessel 24 hours a day. or even beyond his eight (8) working hours which circumstance renders him on call whenever his service is needed. Therefore, he insists that he be paid 16 hours a day by way of overtime. Is the contention of seaman Pedro Sisid tenable? Why?",
        "Answer": "No. The contention of seaman Sisid is not tenable. The fact that he is on board the vessel 24 hours a day does not mean that beyond his eight working hours, he could be also considered as working because he is on call, and thus, is entitled to overtime pay. Because he is a seaman, this circumstance means he is on board his vessel while at sea. But he is not thereby on call as to be entitled to overtime pay because when it is not his working time, he can, if he chooses to do so, use said non-working time effectively and gainfully for his own purpose.

June and July 1991, he rendered, each month, ten (10) hours beyond his regular work schedule. Is he entitled to overtime pay and holiday pay? Why?",
        "Answer": "The entitlement of Gabo to overtime pay and holiday pay is dependent on whether he is a managerial employee or not. If he Is a managerial employee, he is not entitled to overtime pay and holiday pay. The Labor Code provides that the provisions that grant overtime pay and holiday pay shall not apply, among others, to managerial employees. A managerial employee is defined by the Code as referring to those whose primaiy duty consists of the management of the establishment in which they are employed or of a department or subdivision thereof, and to other officers or members of the managerial staff. Gabo, as Chief Engineer, appears to be a managerial employee. On the other hand, his monthly pay is rather low for a managerial employee. Despite his title, his duty may not consist of a management of department or of a subdivision thereof."

        "Question": "The Overseas Construction Company, a domestic corporation with a recruitment license, hired two thousand Filipino workers and assigned them to its construction project in Kuwait. They were given free housing, work clothing and food. The master employment contract approved for them by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) stipulated that they were to work at the overseas jobsite for twelve (12) hours per day and that they were accordingly to be paid wages higher than the POEA-approved schedule of pay rates. The individual employment contracts also contained the same stipulations. And during the pre-departure briefings at the company’s Mandaluyong plant site, the workers were told about these stipulations. By actual compu-tation, the wages paid at the overseas jobsite were at least twenty-five percent (25%) more than the POEA-approved rates. Moreover, the record shows that the workers did not always render the full twelve (12) hours of work stipulated in the employment contract. Back home after completing their one-year overseas assignment, the workers engaged your services as their lawyer to prosecute a complaint with the POEA for recovery of unpaid overtime work. What would your advice be?",
        "Answer": "Before I give an advise, I will first find the answer to this basic question: Were the workers actually paid for their overtime work when they received wages that were at least twenty-five percent (25%) more than the POEA-approved rates? The answer is No if the 25% added to the POEA- approved rate (which we assume is a rate for a day of eight (8) hours work) is only 25% of such POEA-approved daily wage rate. This is because what should be paid to the workers for the four (4) hours that they work overtime in their twelve (12) hour day (a 12-hour work day is 4 hours in excess of an 8-hour work day) should be 50% more of such POEA- approved rate. The four (4) hours of work is 50% of the normal weight (8) hours of work a day plus 25% of such additional 50% for purposes of paying the overtime rate. There is also the night differential pay to take into account because a 12-hour shift will include working hours from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. If the higher-than-the POEA- approved rate is computed as indicated above, I will advise the workers not to sue for they have already been paid for their overtime work. If the higher-than-the-POEA-approved rates is not, however, computed as indicated above, the fact that the POEA-approved the contracts and that the workers agreed to the rates they receive will not be a bar to a complaint for unpaid overtime pay, the right to which cannot be waived. ANOTHER SUGGESTED ANSWER: The rate approved by the POEA has built-in overtime pay. Thus, there is no basis for the claim for overtime pay."

As part of its measures to meet its orders, LKG requires its employees to work beyond eight (8) hours everyday, from Monday to Saturday. It pays its employees an additional 35% of their regular hourly wage for work rendered in excess of eight (8) hours per day. Because of additional orders, LKG now requires two (2) shifts of workers with both shifts working beyond eight (8) hours but only up to a maximum of four (4) hours. Carding is an employee who used to render up to six (6) hours of overtime work before the change in schedule. He complains that the change adversely affected him because now he can only earn up to a maximum of four (4) hours worth of overtime pay. Does Carding have a cause of action against the company?

Besides, Art. 97 of the Labor Code does not guarantee Carding a certain number of hours of overtime work. In Manila Jockey Employees’ Union v.

        "Answer": "Yes. Under Art. 86 of the Labor Code, night shift differential shall be paid to every employee for work performed between 10:00 o’clock in the evening to six o’clock in the morning.

His deal with the models is that Benito will pay them with 3 sets of free clothes per week. Is this arrangement allowed? (2015 Bar Question)",
        "Answer": "No. the arrangement is not allowed. The models are Benito’s employees. As such, their services require compensation in legal tender (Art. 102, Labor Code). The three sets of clothes, regardless of value, are in kind; hence, the former’s compensation is not in the form prescribed by law. ANOTHER SUGGESTED ANSWER: Under Article 102 of the Labor Code, wages of an employee are to be paid only in legal tender, even when expressly requested bv the employee. Hence, no lawful deal in this regard can be entered into by and between Benito and his models. SUGGESTED ALTERNATIVE ANSWER: The models are not employees. Therefore, Art. 102 of the Labor Code applies. The payment does not have to be in legal tender. But even if they are employees, the wage arrangement between Benito and the models is allowed by Art. 97(f) of the Labor Code which defines wage as the remuneration or earning paid to an employee, however designated, capable of being expressed in terms of money, whether fixed or ascertained on a time, task, piece, or commission basis, or other method of calculating the same, which is payable by an employer to an employee under a written or unwritten contract of employment for work done or to be done, or for services rendered or to be rendered.

His work need not be incidental to the business of the employer. His employment may exceed 1 year without necessarily making him a regular employee. A **casual employee** is engaged to perform a job, work, or service which is incidental to the business of the employer; moreover, the definite period of his employment is made known to him at the time of his engagement. His continued employment after the lapse of one year makes him a regular employee. A project worker, on the other hand, is a specific term used to designate workers in the construction industry hired to perform a specific undertaking for a fixed period which is co-terminus with a project or phase thereof determined at the time of the engagement of the employee.

Is there an employer-employee relationship between Star Crafts and the 100 workers from People Plus? Explain. (2015 Bar Question)",
        "Answer": "Yes. People Plus is a labor-only-contractor because it is not substantially capitalized. Neither does it carry on an independent business in which it uses its own investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries or work premises. Hence, it is just an agent or recruiter of workers who perform work directly related to the trade of Star Crafts.

After six (6) months, JKL resumed operations but hired a new set of employees. The old set of employees filed a case for illegal dismissal. If you were the Labor Arbiter, how would you decide the case? (2014 Bar Question)",
        "Answer": "I will rule in favor of the employees. JKL factory merely suspended its operations as a result of the fire that gutted its factory. Article 286 of the Labor Code states that an employer may bona fide suspend the operation of its business for a period not exceeding six (6) months. Since, the suspension of work lasted more than six months, there is now constructive dismissal."

        "Question": "Distinguish the rights of managerial employees from members of a managerial staff.",
        "Answer": "Managerial employees have no collective bargaining rights because, they cannot join or form any other labor organization while officers of a managerial staff are not prohibited from joining, assisting or forming or arresting a supervisor’s union; hence, they can bargain collectively. (Art. 245, Labor Code; National Sugar Refineries Corp. vs. NLRC. 220 SCRA 452). ALTERNATIVE ANSWER: Managerial employees, under Article 212(m) of the Labor Code are vested with the prerogatives to lay down and execute management policies and/or to hire, fire, transfer, promote, lay-off and discipline employees. They are not eligible for the right to self-organization for purposes of collective bargaining. Upon the other hand, members of managerial staff, under Article 82 of the Labor Code, are not vested ’with the above-cited prerogatives. They are not entitled to overtime pay and other benefits under Book III, Title I of the Code."

        "Answer": "1) The employer can legally oppose the inclusion of confidential employees in the existing rank-and-file union. Confidential employees are those who, in the discharge of their regular duties, hold relations of trust and confidence with the employer and are exposed to confidential matters. The inclusion of confidential employees in the bargaining unit of the rank-and-file employees would give the union access to confidential information which may become the source of undue advantage by the union over the employer. 2) The answer would be the same if confidential employees are sought to be included in the supervisory union because confidential employees, being a part of management would not qualify to Join, much less form a labor union. (Philtranco vs. BLR. 174 SCRA 388). ALTERNATIVE ANSWER: My answer would remain the same, even If the confidential employees were sought to be included in the supervisory union. Confidential employees would have the same adverse impact on the bargaining unit of supervisors: Confidential employees' access to highly sensitive information may become the source of undue advantage by the union over the employer.

The votes of the dismissed employees whose cases are pending on appeal shall be likewise counted, if the vote is necessary to determine the winner. In this case, there are 410 valid votes, so 206 votes are necessary to win. If Union A won, the vote of the 6 dismissed employees should be tallied. (B) Yes.

The petition did not, however, state the number of its members in the bargaining unit. After hearing, the med-arbiter ordered a certification election in the company-wide unit. Not satisfied therewith, the company elevated the order to the Secretary of Labor and Employment. If you were the Secretary of Labor and Employment, how will you decide this case? Give your reasons.",
        "Answer": "As Secretary of Labor and Employment, I will affirm the order for a certification election made by the Med Arbiter. But I will amend the order. Instead of a certification election in a company wide unit, I will order a certification election only for a bargaining unit composed of rank and file employees, or only for a bargaining unit composed of supervisory employees, in whichever bargaining unit are found the members of the petitioning labor organization. The order for a certification election is proper even if the petition for certification election filed by AH Labor Organization is not supported by at least 25% of the employees of the appropriate collective bargaining unit. The petition for certification election is filed in an unorganized establish-ment there being, as yet. no bargaining agent in PMG Stevedoring Company. A petition for certification election in an unorganized establishment does not require the consent of at least 25% of all the employees in the bargaining unit (Art. 257. Labor Code). This is a requirement only for petitions filed in an organized establishment. (Art. 256, Labor Code) But the bargaining unit cannot be company wide. Rep. Act No. 6715, in reaffirming the right of supervisory employees to form a union, provides that they can only be members of unions whose members are all supervisory employees. This restriction means that, unlike the situation before Rep. Act No. 6715. supervisory employees and rank and file employees could no longer belong to one union. Thus, as a result, a bargaining unit could no longer be composed of rank and file employees and supervisor employees. A POINT TO CONSIDER: A bar examinee may. however, assume that the reference to the bargaining unit being a companywide unit means either a companywide unit of all rank and file employees or a companywide unit of all supervisory employees. ALTERNATIVE ANSWER: As Secretary, I would affirm the order of the med- arbiter. There is no bar to the election, and the employees are entitled to a speedy determination of their bargaining representative so that they could exercise their right to bargain collectively."

Why? b) Which union should be certified as bargaining representative of tire employees? Why? c) Should a new election be conducted with all the four unions participating? Reasons.",
        "Answer": "a) Yes, There was a valid election. The Labor Code requires that for a certification election to be valid, at least a majority of all eligible voters in the unit must have cast their votes. (Article 256, Labor Code) Here, the number of eligible voters was 800. Seven hundred (700) or more than a majority voted. Thus, the election was valid. b) No union could be certified as bargaining representative of employees. To be certified, a labor union should receive a majority of valid votes cast of at least a majority of the 800 votes cast which should be 401 votes. (Article 256, Labor Code) The union obtaining the highest number of votes is Union A. It obtained only 200 votes, short of the majority by 201 votes. c) A new election should be conducted, but the Labor Code provides that it should be an election not at all the four unions who participated in the election but a run-off election where only the labor unions receiving the two highest numbers of votes will participate. This run-off election can be held because in the earlier election, the total number of votes for all the contending unions was at least fifty percent (50%) of the number of votes cast.

Company America and the union entered into a five (5) year collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Three (3) years thereafter, the Company received a demand letter from the union for renegotiation of the terms and conditions of the CBA on the ground that the cost of living and prices of the essential commodities have gone up by 30% since the CBA was concluded.",
        "Answer": "The maximum term is five (5) years as to the representation aspect. All other provisions of a CBA shall only have a maximum term of three (3) years. The demand letter of the union for renegotiation of the economic terms of the CBA is valid and is given to avoid any labor dispute that would adversely affect the economy."

Is this agreement a valid one? (2015 Bar Question) B. XYZ Company and XYZ Employees Union (XYZEU) reach a deadlock in their negotiation for a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA). XYZEU files a notice of strike; XYZ Company proposes to XYZEU that the deadlock be submitted instead to voluntary arbitration. If you are counsel for XYZEU, what advice would you give the union as to the: (1) propriety of the request of XYZ Company, and (2) the relative advantages/disadvantages between voluntary arbitration and compulsory arbitration? (2015 Bar Question)",
        "Answer": "The agreement is valid because the preferred mode of settling labor disputes is through voluntary modes, like voluntary arbitration. The agreement is consistent with Sec. 3, Art. XIII of the Constitution. Moreover, Art. 262 of the Labor Code authorizes a voluntary arbitrator to hear and decide by agreement of the parties, all other labor disputes. (1) As counsel, I will advise the union to accede to the request of the company. Besides being the constitutionally preferred mode of dispute settlement, voluntary arbitration is less adversarial and more expeditious. (2) The advantages of voluntary arbitration are: (a) faster, cheaper and easier; (b) Voluntary Arbitrator/s, unlike Labor Arbiters, cannot be compelled to render decision in thirty (30) days from submission of case for decision, as such period is only advisory in character."

The determination of whether a party has engaged in unlawful surface bargaining is a question of the intent of the party in question, which can only be inferred from the totality of the challenged party’s conduct both at and away from the bargaining table. It involves the question of whether an employer’s conduct demonstrates an unwillingness to bargain in good faith or is merely hard bargaining (Standard Chartered Bank Employees Union (NUBE)v. Confesor, 432 SCRA 308 ). (2) BLUE-SKY BARGAINING is defined as 'unrealistic and unreasonable demands in negotiations by either or both labor and management, where neither concedes anything and demands the impossible' (Standard Chartered Bank Employees Union (NUBE) v.

The said fund, without any assistance given by the employer, is used for refreshment and other expenses of the labor union whenever the employees go on a picnic, on an excursion, or hold a Christmas party. Is the employer liable for unfair labor practice under Article 248(d) of the Labor Code? Explain your answer.",
        "Answer": "No. If the contributions of the employer benefit all the employees and there is no employee discriminated against, there is no unfair labor practice. The contributions may be considered a fringe benefit given by the employer. ALTERNATIVE ANSWER: If the regular contributions are pursuant to a CBA provision, there is no unfair labor practice. If not pursuant to a CBA violation, the assistance may constitute an unfair labor practice. ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE ANSWER: If Art. 248(d) is strictly applied, the giving of money by the employer to the recreation fund of the labor union is an unfair labor practice because said Article considers as an unfair labor practice 'the giving of financial or other support to it (meaning a union) or to its organizers or officers.'

After 6 months, a majority of the members of Union X formed Union Y and sought management recognition. The latter responded by not dealing with either union. But, when the CBA’s economic provisions had to be renegotiated towards the end of the term of the CBA, the management chose to negotiate with Union Y, the newer union. Thus, Union X which negotiated the existing CBA charged the company with unfair labor practice (ULP). The company argued that it committed no unfair labor practice since the supposed violation had nothing to do with economic provisions of the CBA. Is the management right? (2011 BAR)",
        "Answer": "No. The duty to bargain collectively is not merely confined to economic provisions but to all terms and conditions of employment. The management should negotiate with Union X, the existing certified bargaining agent, especially on the economic provisions of the existing CBA because Article 253 of the Labor Code mandates the continuance of the terms and conditions in the CBA until a new one is executed."

In the certification election Union 'B' lost. Is there an unfair labor practice? Reasons.",
        "Answer": "Ocean Supermart was guilty of unfair labor practice. The Labor Code (in Art. 248) provides that it is unfair labor practice for an employer 'To interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their right to self-organization' and 'for an employer to initiate, dominate, assist or otherwise interfere in the formation or administration of any labor organization, including the giving of financial or other support to it or its organizations or supporters.' In the question given, Ocean Supermart issued a written statement expressing the hope that the employees refrain from joining a union. It also express a preference for Union 'A'. These statements could be considered interference with the exercise by employees by the right to self-organize.

        "Answer": "A strike may be an economic strike, namely, it is a strike caused by a deadlock at the bargaining table. A deadlock may arise because the offer of the employer, e.g., its offer of a 20% across-the-board increase in wages and salaries, was not accepted by the Union who wanted a 50% increase. After considering the matter, the employer may improve its offer, e.g. it offers a 35% increase. This improved offer of the employer may be submitted to the union members on or before the 30th day of the strike. The secret balloting that will determine whether a majority of the union members accept the improved offer of the employer is the so-called ''improved offer balloting. In case it is a lockout, and not a strike, what may be the subject matter of a secret balloting, this lime among the members of the Board of Directors of the employer, may be the reduced offer of the union, i.e., instead of asking for 50% across the board increase in wages and salaries, it may reduce its demand to 25 % ."

Following the call for a nationwide strike, Union 'X' staged a strike and put up a picket the following day. As a result, the company’s operations were paralyzed although company officials and supervisory employees were allowed ingress and egress to and from the company premises. The picket was likewise peaceful. On May 28, 1989, the UKM leadership announced the end of the 'Welga ng Bayan.' Union 'X' immediately lifted its picket and its members went back to work.

It is the prerogative of the management to assign its employees to where the management believes their services could be best utilized.

He entered into a 'lease contract' with Nick for the latter to drive the jeepney for 12 hours daily on a fix 'rental' of P1,500.00. The lease contract also stipulated that Nick should observe the rules and regulations of Jim respecting the maintenance of the jeepney and dealing with passengers. Jim filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction as the agreement between him and Nick is a lease contract. Rule on the motion and explain. (2016)",
        "Answer": "Jim's Motion to Dismiss must be denied. Although Jim and Nick called their contract as a lease, it is actually a contract of employment, and the rentals that Nick must pay to Jim is actually a boundary. Martinez v. National Labor Relations Commission (G.R. No. 117495, May 29,1997) teaches that jeepney owners/operators exercise control over jeepney drivers. The fact that the drivers do not receive fixed wages but get only that in excess of the so-called 'boundary' is not a circumstance which would negate the existence of employer-employee relationship."

NNN objects to the transfer of Anya claiming that she is barred from working in a competing company for a period of three years from the expiration of her contract. Anya proceeds to sign with PNN which then asks her to anchor their nightly newscast. NNN sues Anya and PNN before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), asking for a labor injunction.

(2015 Bar Question) (b) What are the grounds for a labor injunction to issue?  (c) Distinguish the jurisdiction of a Labor Arbiter from that of the NLRC. (2015 Bar Question)",
        "Answer": "(a) No. The NLRC has no jurisdiction. The case is a civil dispute. The issue revolves around the enforcement of the exclusivity clause in the contract, which is a matter of civil relations. (b) A labor injunction may issue when the matter involves a labor dispute, and is necessary to protect the interest of the complaining party, taking into account the irreparable damage or injury to the moving party. In case of illegal dismissal, the Labor Arbiter has the power to issue a restraining order or writ of injunction, where the reinstatement aspect of the case is involved. (c) The Labor Arbiter has jurisdiction over all original claims listed in Art. 224 (Art. 217). The NLRC has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all cases decided by the Labor Arbiter and the DOLE Regional Director.

April 20 being a Good Friday and the following Saturday having been declared a non-working public holiday by the President, the employer filed his appeal with the NLRC from the said decision on April 23. 1984. (1) Was the appeal filed on time? Explain your reason. (2) Assuming the decision of the labor arbiter is affirmed by the NLRC. what is the recourse of the employer? State the nature of the action, the court which has jurisdiction over the action, and the period within which the same must be filed.",
        "Answer": "(1) The appeal was filed on time. The Supreme Court has ruled that in the counting of the ten day period within which to file an appeal, if the tenth day is a holiday, then the appeal may be filed on the day after said holiday. But if the day after said holiday is also a non-working public holiday as in the case in the question, then the appeal cannot be filed because government offices are closed. The appeal could then be filed on the day after such non-working public holiday. But again, in the case, this day is a Sunday when government offices are also closed. Thus, the filing on the following Monday. April 23. is still within the ten-day period. (Pacana v. National Labor Relations Commission, et al.. G.R. No. 83513.

In view of the above provision, the employer in the case in the question who is aggrieved by the decision of the NLRC should file a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court within a reasonable period from receipt of the decision which is the subject of the petition for certiorari usually within 30 days.

        "Question": "Distinguish the terms 'conciliation,' 'mediation' and 'arbitration'.  (2010 Bar Question)",
        "Answer": "There is a DOLE official called a 'Conciliator Mediator'. He is an officer of the NCMB whose principal function is to assist in the settlement and disposition of labor - management disputes through conciliation and preventive mediation. However, he does not promulgate decisions that settle controversies about rights, which are demandable and enforceable. The latter is called arbitration and is the function of a labor arbiter or a voluntary arbitrator. ALTERNATIVE ANSWER: (1) CONCILIATION is the process of dispute management whereby parties in dispute are brought together for the purpose of: (1) amicably settling the case upon a fair compromise; (2) determining the real parties in interest; (3) defining and simplifying the issues in the case; (4) entering into admissions or stipulations of facts; and (5) threshing out all other preliminary matters (Section 3, Rule V, 2005 NLRC Rules of Procedure). In resolving labor disputes, this comes before arbitration, as a mandatory process, pursuant to the State policy of promoting and emphasizing conciliation as modes of settling labor disputes (Art. 211 (A)(a), Labor Code). (2) MEDIATION is a voluntary process of settling dispute whereby the parties elect a mediator to facilitate the communication and negotiation between the parties in dispute for the purpose of assisting them in reaching a compromise (Sec. 3(q), Rep. Act No. 9285 or the Alternative Dispute Resolution Law). (3) ARBITRATION is a system of dispute settlement that may be compulsory or voluntary, whereby the parties are compelled by. the government, or agree to submit their dispute before an arbiter, with the intention to accept the resolution of said arbiter over the dispute as final and binding on them (Luzon Development Bank v. Association of Luzon Development Employees, 249 SCRA 162 ). In this jurisdiction, compulsory arbitration in labor disputes are submitted to a labor arbiter, whose powers and functions are clearly defined under Article 217(a) of the Labor Code; whereas in voluntary arbitration, the powers and functions of the voluntary arbitrator or panel of voluntary arbitrators elected to resolve the parties’ dispute involve the interpretation and implementation of the parties’ collective bargaining agreement, pursuant to Articles 260-262 of the Labor Code."

Under Article 129, for the Regional Director to exercise Jurisdiction, the aggregate money claims of an employee should not exceed P5.000.00.

(b) What are the consequences of the assumption of jurisdiction by the Secretary of Labor, and of the disobedience to the return to work? Explain your answer.  (2017 Bar Question)",

        "Question": "Philippine Electric Company is engaged in electric power generation and distribution. It is a unionized company with Kilusang Makatao as the union representing its rank-and-file employees. During the negotiations for their expired collective bargaining agreement (CBA), the parties duly served their proposals and counter-proposals on one another. The parties, however, failed to discuss the merits of their proposals and counter-proposals in any formal negotiation meeting because their talks already bogged down on the negotiation ground rules, i.e., on the question of how they would conduct their negotiations, particularly on whether to consider retirement as a negotiable issue. Because of the continued impasse, the union went on strike. The Secretary of Labor and Employment immediately assumed jurisdiction over the dispute to avert widespread electric power interruption in the country. After extensive discussions and the filing of position papers (before the National Conciliation and Mediation Board and before the Secretary himself) on the validity of the union's strike and on the wage and other economic issues (including the retirement issue), the DOLE Secretary ruled on the validity of the strike and on the disputed CBA issues, and ordered the parties to execute a CBA based on his rulings.

In the pertinent Memorandum, management explained that too much texting and phone-calling by employees disrupted company operations.

The union countered with a prohibitory injunction case (with prayer for the issuance of a temporary- restraining order) Filed with the Regional Trial Court, challenging the validity and constitutionality of the cell phone ban. The company filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the case should be referred to the grievance machinery pursuant to an existing Collective Bargaining Agreement with Union X, and eventually to Voluntary Arbitration. Is the company correct? Explain.  (2010 Bar Question)",
        "Answer": "YES. Termination cases arising in or resulting from the interpretation and implementation of collective bargaining agreements, and interpretation and enforcement of company personnel policies which were initially processed at the various steps of the plant-level Grievance Procedures under the parties collective bargaining agreements, fall within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the voluntary arbitrator pursuant to Article 217 (c) and Article 261 of the Labor Code. ALTERNATIVE ANSWER: NO. The Regional Trial Court has jurisdiction to hear and decide the prohibitory injunction case filed by Union X against Company C to enjoin the latter from implementing the memorandum-policy against use of cell phones in the factory. What is at issue is Union X S challenge against the validity and constitutionality of the cell phone ban being implemented by Company C.

Said shares were held in trust for Janina by the Corporate Secretary of Sun Life and the latter can vote the shares and receive dividends for Janina.

Double taxation is prohibited when it is an imposition of taxes on the same subject matter, for the same purpose, by the same taxing authority within the same jurisdiction, during the same taxing period, with the same kind or character of a tax (84 C.J.S.131-132). It is permissible if taxes are of different nature or character, or the two taxes are imposed by different taxing authorities (Villanueva v. City of Iloilo, G.R.

The bank regularly deducted 20% final withholding tax on the interest income from the time deposit. Alfredo contends that the 20% final tax on the interest income constituted double taxation because his salary had been already subjected to withholding tax. Is Alfredo’s contention correct? Explain your answer. (3%) ",
        "Answer": "No. Double taxation means taxing for the same tax period the same thing or activity twice, when it should be taxed but once, for the same purpose and with the same kind or character of tax. (CIR v. Citytrust Investment Phils., G.R. Nos. 139786, 140857, September 27, 2006) The 20% final tax is imposed on the interest income, while the tax earlier withheld is on the salary or compensation income. Thus, though both pertain to income tax, they do not pertain to the same thing or activity and consequently, no double taxation exists."

One month after, Rainier sold the lot and building to Healthy Smoke Company (HSC) for P200 million. Lucky filed its annual tax return and declared its gain from the sale of the lot and building in the amount of P750,000.00. An investigation conducted by the BIR revealed that two months prior to the sale of the properties to Rainier, Lucky received P40 million from HSC and not from Rainier. Said amount of P40 million was debited by HSC and reflected in its trial balance as other inv. - Lucky Bldg. The month after, another P40 million was reflected in HSC's trial balance as other inv. - Lucky Bldg. The BIR concluded that there is tax evasion since the real buyer of the properties of Lucky is HSC and not Rainier. It issued an assessment for deficiency income tax in the amount of P79 million against Lucky. Lucky argues that it resorted to tax avoidance or a tax saving device, which is allowed by the NIRC and BIR rules since it paid the correct taxes based on its sale to Rainier.

The real buyer from Lucky is HBC as evidenced by the direct receipt of payments by the former from the latter where the latter recorded other investments — Lucky Building. The scheme of resorting to a two-step transaction in selling the property to the ultimate buyer in order to escape paying higher taxes is considered as outside of those lawful means allowed in mitigating tax liabilities which makes Lucky criminally and civilly liable. Hence, the BIR is correct in assessing taxes on Lucky (CIR v. Estate of Benigno P. Todo, Jr., G.R. No.147188, September 14, 2004, 438 SCRA 290)."

        "Question": "You are the retained tax counsel of ABC Corp. Your client informed you that they have been directly approached with a proposal by a BIR insider (i.e., a middle rank BIR official) on the tax matter they have referred to you for handling. The BIR insider’s proposal is to settle the matter by significantly reducing the assessment, but he will get 50% of the savings arising from the reduced assessment. What tax, criminal and ethical considerations will you take into account in giving your advice? Explain the relevance of each of these considerations. ",
        "Answer": "As a lawyer, I have the responsibility to give only a lawful advice. Canon I of the Code of Professional Responsibility mandates me to “uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of the land and promote respect for law and legal processes. Rule 1.01 states that “a lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.” Rule 1.02 provides that “a lawyer shall not counsel or abet activities aimed at defiance of the law or at lessening confidence in the legal system.” Therefore, I will advise my client not to agree with the proposal of the BIR officer. Agreeing with the proposal will result in criminal prosecution under the following laws: Under the NIRC, the officers of the board who authorized the tax evasion will be liable under Section 253(C), while the corporation shall be liable under Section 256. The BIR official is liable under Section 269 which provides for the violations committed by government enforcement officers. Paragraph (d) of Section 269 provides that one of these violations is “offering or undertaking to accomplish, file or submit a report or assessment on a taxpayer without the appropriate examination of the books of accounts or tax liability, or offering or undertaking to submit a report or assessment less than the amount due the Government for any consideration or compensation, or conspiring or colluding with another or others to defraud the revenues or otherwise violate the provisions of this Code.” Under the Revised Penal Code, the officers of the corporation shall be liable under Article 212 for corruption of public officials while the BIR official is liable for direct bribery. Both my client and the BIR official will also be liable under Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti- Graft and Corrupt Practices Act."

        "Question": "On August 31, 2014, Haelton Corporation (HC), thru its authorized representative Ms. Pares, sold a 16-storey commercial building known as Haeltown Building to Mr. Belly for P100 million. Mr. Belly, in turn, sold the same property on the same day to Bell Gates, Inc. (BGI) for P200 million. These two (2) transactions were evidenced by two (2) separate Deeds of Absolute Sale notarized on the same day by the same notary public. Investigations by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) showed that: (1) the Deed of Absolute Sale between Mr. Belly and BGI was notarized ahead of the sale between HC and Mr. Belly; (2) as early as May 17, 2014, HC received P40 million from BGI, and not from Mr. Belly; (3) the said payment of P40 million was recorded by BGI in its books as of June 30, 2014 as investment in Haeltown Building; and (4) the substantial portion of P40 million was withdrawn by Ms. Pares through the declaration of cash dividends to all its stockholders. Based on the foregoing, the BIR sent Haeltown Corporation a Notice of Assessment for deficiency income tax arising from an alleged simulated sale of the aforesaid commercial building to escape the higher corporate income tax rate of thirty percent (30%). What is the liability of Haeltown Corporation, if any? ",
        "Answer": "The tax planning scheme adopted by Haeltown Corporation constitutes tax evasion. According to CIR v. Estate of Benigno Toda (G.R. No. 147188, September 14, 2004), a transaction where a taxpayer made it appear that there were two sales of the property was considered “tainted with fraud.” The sole purpose of acquiring and transferring title of the property on the same day was to create a tax shelter. The sale to Mr. Belly (which is subject to individual capital gains tax) was to mislead the BIR and avoid the higher corporate income tax."

Taxation is inherently legislative. - Only the legislature has full discretion as to the persons, property, occupation or business to be taxed provided these are all within the State’s territorial jurisdiction. It can also finally determine the amount or rate of tax, the kind of tax to be imposed and the method of collection (1 Cooley 176184). Taxation is territorial. - Taxation may be exercised only within the territorial jurisdiction of the taxing authority (61 Am. Jur. 88). Within the territorial jurisdiction, the taxing authority may determine the place of taxation” or “ tax situs”, Taxation is subject to international comity. - This is a limitation which is founded on reciprocity designed to maintain a harmonious and productive relationships among the various states. Under international comity, a state must recognize the generally- accepted tenets of international law, among which are the principles of sovereign equality among states and of their freedom from suit without their consent, that limit the authority of a government to effectively impose taxes on a sovereign state and its instrumentalities, as well as on its property held, and activities undertaken in that capacity."

The total sales of airplane tickets transacted by Narotel for SAA in 2012 amounted to P10,000,000.00. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed SAA deficiency income taxes at the rate of 30% on its taxable income, finding that SAA’s airline ticket sales constituted income derived from sources within the Philippines. SAA filed a protest on the ground that the alleged deficiency income taxes should be considered as income derived exclusively from sources outside the Philippines since SAA only serviced passengers outside Philippine territory.

KIA filed a protest on the ground that the P2,968,156.00 should be considered as income derived exclusively from sources outside the Philippines since KIA only serviced passengers outside Philippine territory. Is the position of KIA tenable? Reasons. (4%)",
        "Answer": "KIA’s position is not tenable. The revenue it derived in 1997 from sales of airplane tickets in the Philippines, through its agent PAL, is considered as income from within the Philippines, subject to the 35% tax based on its taxable income pursuant to Section 25(a)( 1) of the Tax Code of 1977. The transacting of business in the Philippines through its local sales agent, makes KIA a resident foreign corporation despite the absence of landing rights, thus, it is taxable on income derived from within. The source of an income is the property, activity or service that produced the income. In the instant case, it is the sale of tickets in the Philippines which is the activity that produced the income. KIA’s income being derived from within, is subject to Philippine income tax (CIR v.

The corresponding withholding tax on dividend income — 30% for individual and 35% for corporate non-resident stockholders — was deducted at source and remitted to the BIR. On May 15,1984, ABCD filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue a formal claim for refund, alleging that under the RP-US Tax Treaty, the deduction withheld at source as tax on dividends earned was fixed at 25% of said income. Thus, ABCD asserted that it overpaid the withholding tax due on the cash dividends given to its non-resident stockholders in the U.S. the Commissioner denied the claim. On January 17, 1985, ABCD filed a petition with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) reiterating its demand for refund. Is the contention of ABCD Corporation correct? Why or why not? (3%)",

Under RA 10701, buyers of private vehicles are required to pay a transport tax equivalent to 5% of the total purchase price per vehicle purchased.

RA 10701 further provide that existing owners of private vehicles shall be required to pay a tax equivalent to 5% of the current fair market value of every vehicle registered with the LTO. However, RA 10701 exempts owners of public utility vehicles and the Government from the coverage of the 5% transport tax. A group of private vehicle owners sue on the ground that the law is unconstitutional for contravening the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. Rule on the constitutionality and validity of RA 10701. (5%) ",
        "Answer": "RA 10701 is valid and constitutional. A levy of tax is not unconstitutional because it is not intrinsically equal and uniform in its operation. The uniformity rule does not prohibit classification for purposes of taxation. (British American Tobacco v. Jose Isidro N. Camacho, G.R. No. 163583, April 15, 2009) Uniformity of taxation, like the kindred concept of equal protection, merely requires that all subjects or objects of taxation, similarly situated, are to be treated alike both in privileges and liabilities. Uniformity does not forfend classification as long as: (1) the standards that are used therefor are substantial and not arbitrary, (2) the categorization is germane to achieve the legislative purpose, (3) the law applies, all things being equal, to both present and future conditions, and (4) the classification applies equally well to all those belonging to the same class. (Rufino R. Tan v. Ramon R. Del Rosario, Jr., G.R. Nos. 109289, October 3, 1994, 237 SCRA 324).

The test of exemption from taxation is the use of the property for purposes mentioned in the Constitution. The leased portion of the building may be subject to real property tax since such lease is for commercial purposes, thereby, it removes the asset from the property tax exemption granted under the Constitution.

        "Answer": "A. The reclaimed properties are not subject to real property tax because LLL is a government instrumentality. Instrumentality refers to any agency of the National Government, not integrated within the department framework vested with special functions or jurisdiction by law, endowed with some if not all corporate powers, administering special funds, and enjoying operational autonomy, usually through a charter. Under the law, real property owned by the Republic of the Philippines (Republic) is exempt from real property tax unless the beneficial use thereof has been granted to a taxable person. When the title of the real property is transferred to LLL, the Republic remains the owner of the real property. Thus, such arrangement does not result in the loss of the tax exemption. B. No. As a rule, properties owned by the Republic of the Philippines are exempt from real property tax except when the beneficial use thereof has been granted, for consideration or otherwise, to a taxable person.

A month after the foreclosure, Hopeful Corporation exercised its right of redemption and was able to redeem the property. Is Generous Bank liable to pay capital gains tax as a result of the foreclosure sale? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "No. Since Hopeful Corporation exercised its right to redeem the property, Generous Bank is not liable to pay capital gains tax on the foreclosure sale. As stated in the analogous case of Supreme Transliner, Inc., v. BPI Family Savings Bank, Inc. (G.R. No. 165617, February 25, 2011, 644 SCRA 59), Rev. Regs. No. 4-99 expressly provides that if a mortgagor exercises his right of redemption within one year from the issuance of the certificate of sale, no capital gains tax shall be imposed because no sale or transfer of real property was realized. It is only in case of non-redemption by Hopeful Corporation that the obligation to pay capital gains tax arises, which shall be based on the bid price of the highest bidder. The tax will be imposed only upon the expiration of the one-year period of redemption. Furthermore, the obligation to pay the capital gains tax would primarily fall on the mortgagor, Hopeful Corporation, and not on Generous Bank."

The liability to pay is already fixed in 2007 when the services were rendered, and the amount of such liability is determinable with reasonable accuracy in the same year.

        "Question": "Lucky V Corporation (Lucky) owns a IO-storey building on a 2,000 square meter lot in the City of Makati. It sold the lot and building to Rainier. for P80 million. One month after, Rainier sold the lot and building to Healthy Smoke Company (HSC) for P200 million. Lucky filed its annual tax return and declared its gain from the sale of the lot and building in the amount of P750,000.00. An investigation conducted by the BIR revealed that two months prior to the sale of the properties to Rainier, Lucky received P40 million from HSC and not from Rainier. Said amount of P40 million was debited by HSC and reflected in its trial balance as 'other inv. - Lucky Bldg.' The month after, another P40 million was reflected in HSC's trial balance as 'other inv. - Lucky Bldg.' The BIR concluded that there is tax evasion since the real buyer of the properties of Lucky is HSC and not Rainier. It issued an assessment for deficiency income tax in the amount of P79 million against Lucky. Lucky argues that it resorted to tax avoidance or a tax saving device, which is allowed by the NIRC and BIR rules since it paid the correct taxes based on its sale to Rainier. On the other hand, Rainier and HSC also paid the prescribed taxes arising from the sale by Rainier to HSC. Is the BIR correct in assessing taxes on Lucky? Explain. (5%) ",
        "Answer": "Yes. The sale of the property by Lucky V Corporation (Lucky) to Rainier and consequently the sale by Rainier to HSC being prompted more on the mitigation of tax liabilities than for legitimate business purposes, therefore Constitutes tax evasion. The real buyer from Lucky is HBC as evidenced by the direct receipt of payments by the former from the latter where the latter recorded 'other investments — Lucky Building'. The scheme of resorting to a two-step transaction in selling the property to the ultimate buyer in order to escape paying higher taxes is considered as outside of those lawful means allowed in mitigating tax liabilities which makes Lucky criminally and civilly liable. Hence, the BIR is correct in assessing taxes on Lucky (CIR v. Estate of Benigno P. Todo, Jr., G.R. No.147188, September 14, 2004, 438 SCRA 290)."

The RTC granted the motion to dismiss and, accordingly it ordered the dismissal of the complaint. Al Pakino filed a motion for reconsideration which the RTC denied. As nothing more could be done by Al Pakino before the RTC, he file an appeal before the Court of Appeals (CA). Robert White moved for dismissal of the appeal in the ground that the same involved purely a question of law and should have been filed with the Supreme Court (SC). However, Al Pakino claimed that the appeal involved mixed questions of fact and law because there must be a factual determination if, indeed, Al Pakino was duly authorized by Goodfeather Corporation to file the complaint. Whose position is correct? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Al Pakino is correct in claiming that the appeal involved mixed questions of fact and law. There is a question of law when the doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on a certain state of facts. On the other hand, there is a question of fact, when the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of alleged facts. (Mirant Philippines Corporation v. Sario, G.R. No. 197598, November 21, 2012). Since the complaint was dismissed due to the alleged lack of appropriate board resolution from the Board of Directors of Goodfeather Corporation, the appeal will necessarily involve a factual determination of the authority to file the Complaint for the said Corporation.

Matigas in conspiracy with Carpinter, a private individual, for violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act (RA) No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, as amended). Before the information could be filed with the Sandiganbayan, Gov. Matigas was killed in an ambush. This, notwithstanding, an information was filed against Gov. Matigas and Carpintero. At the Sandiganbayan, Carpintero through counsel, filed a Motion to Quash the information, on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, arguing that with the death of Gov. Matigas, there is no public officer charged in the information. Is the Motion to Quash legally tenable? ",
        "Answer": "NO. The Motion to quash is not legally tenable. While it is true that by reason of the death of Gov. Matigas, there is no longer any public officer with whom he can be charge for violation of R.A. 3019, it does not mean, however, that the allegation of conspiracy between them can no longer be proved or that their alleged conspiracy is already expunged. The only thing extinguished by the death of Gov. Matigas is his criminal liability. His death did not extinguish the crime nor did it remove the basis of the charge of conspiracy between him and Carpintero. The requirement before a private person may be indicated for violation of Section 3(q) of R.A. 3019, among others, is that such private person must be alleged to have acted in conspiracy with a public officer. The law, however, does not require that such person must, in all instances, be indicated together with the public officer. Indeed, it is not necessary to join all alleged co-conspirators in an indictment for conspiracy (People of the Philippines v. Henry T. Go, G.R. No. 168539, March 25, 2014)."

No. 126462, November 12, 2002; Penta Pacific Realty Corporation v. Ley Construction and Development Corporation, G.R. No. 161589, November 24,2014).

The designation of Special Commercial Court was merely intended as a procedural tool to expedite the resolution of commercial cases in line with the court’s exercise of jurisdiction. This designation was not made by statute but only by an internal Supreme Court rule under its authority to promulgates rules governing matters of procedure."

        "Question": "To recover possession, Estrella filed a complaint for ejectment with the Municipal Trial Court (MTC), alleging that she is the true owner of the land as evidenced by her certificate of title and tax declaration which showed the assessed value of the property as P21,000.00. On the other hand, John refuted Estrella’s claim of ownership and submitted in evidence a Deed of Absolute Sale between him and Estrella. After the filing of John’s answer, the MTC observed that the real issue was one of ownership and not of possession. Hence, the MTC dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal by Estrella to the Regional Trial Court (RTC), a full-blown trial was conducted as if the case was originally filed with it. The RTC reasoned that based on the assessed value of the property, it was the court of proper jurisdiction. Eventually, the RTC rendered a judgment declaring John as the owner of the land and, hence, entitled to the possession thereof.  a. Was the MTC correct in dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction? Why or why not?",
        "Answer": "The Metropolitan Trial Court was not correct in dismissing the Complaint for lack of jurisdiction. It is well settled that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations contained in the complaint. The contention of defendant in his Motion to Dismiss has nothing to do in the determination of jurisdiction. Otherwise, jurisdiction would become dependent almost entirely upon the whims of the defendant (Medical Plaza Makati Condominium v. Cullen, G.R. No. 181416, November 11, 2013). Relative thereto, the Municipal Trial Courts have exclusive original jurisdiction over cases of forcible entry and unlawful detainer (Section 33, B.P. 129). Hence, the Metropolitan Trial Court is not correct in dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. Besides, the rules allow provisional determination of ownership in ejectment cases when the defendant raises the defense of ownership in his pleadings and the question of possession cannot be resolved without deciding the issue of ownership (Sec. 16, Rule 70). Accordingly, the inferior courts have jurisdiction to resolve questions of ownership whenever it is necessary to decide the question of possession in an ejectment case. (Serreno v. Spouses Gutierrez, G.R. No. 162366, November 10, 2006)."

The Family Court judge, in granting the motion for extension of the TPO, declined to rule on the constitutionality of R.A. No. 9262.

Juan brought his complaint to the Council of Elders of said barangay which implements the bodong justice system. Both appeared before the council where they verbally agreed that Pedro will pay in installments on specific due dates. Pedro reneged on his promise. Juan filed a complaint for sum of money before the Municipal Trial Court (MTC). Pedro filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground that the case did not pass through the barangay conciliation under R.A. No. 7160 and that the RTC, not the MTC, has jurisdiction. In his opposition, Juan argued that the intervention of the Council of Elders is substantial compliance with the requirement of R.A. No. 7160 and the claim of P50,000.00 is clearly within the jurisdiction of the MTC. As MTC judge, rule on the motion and explain. ",
        "Answer": "The Motion to Dismiss should be denied. As a general rule, no complaint involving any matter within the authority of the Lupon shall be instituted or filed directly in court for adjudication unless there has been a confrontation between the parties in the barangay and no settlement was reached section 412(a) of Republic Act No. 7160; April Wolf, G. Martinez, G.R. No.162084, June 28, 2005). However, in barangays where majority of the inhabitants are members of indigenous cultural communities, local systems of settling disputes through their councils of datus or elders shall be recognized without prejudice to the applicable provisions of the Local Government Code (Sections 399, R.A. 7160). As a consequence, the customs and traditions of indigenous cultural communities shall be applied in settling disputes between members of the cultural communities Sections 412, R.A. 7160), thus, the confrontation between Pedro and Juan before the Council of Elders of their barangay is sufficient compliance with the precondition for filing the case in court under Section 412 of R.A. No. 7160 (Zamora y Heirs of Izquierdo, G.R. No.146195, November 18, 2004). Be that as it may, it is well-settled that the mode of enforcement of an amicable settlement under the Katarungan Pambarangay Law does not rule out the right of rescission under Art. 2041 of the Civil Code (Crisanta Miguel v. Montanez,G.R. No.191336, January 25,2014). Accordingly, Juan filed a complaint for sum Of money in the MTC, he is deemed to have rescinded the compromise agreement reached before theCouncil of Elders of the barangay. Henceforth. Pedro is incorrect in alleging that the RTC, not the MTC has jurisdiction over Juan's claim. Considering that the claim is only for P50,000.00, the case is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the MTC under B.P. Big. 129 and may proceed pursuant to AM. No. 08-8-7-SC or the \"Rules of Procedure for Small Claims Cases.\" Notably, a motion to dismiss is among the prohibited pleadings under Section 14(a) of said rules. Similarly, Juan’s claim of P50,000.00 may be governed by the 1991 Rules on Summary Procedure which clearly falls within the jurisdiction of the MTC, ergo, the motion to dismiss based on lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter should be denied (Section 19(a)1 1991 Rules on Summary Procedure)."

The spouses want to collect a loan of P25,000.00 from Jojo but do not have the money to pay the filing fees.  B) If the spouses do not qualify under Rule 141, what other remedy can they avail of under the rules to exempt them from paying the filing fees? (2.5)",
        "Answer": "The Spouses can avail The following remedies under the rules in order to be exempted from the payment of the filing fees: 1. If the applicant for exemption meets the salary and property requirements under Section 19 of Rule 141, then the grant of the application is mandatory. On the other hand, when the application does not satisfy one or both requirements then the application should not be denied outright; instead, the court should apply the \"indigency test\" under Section 21 of Rule 3 and use its sound discretion in determining the merits of the prayer for exemption (Algura v. Local Government Unit of the City of Naga, G.R. No.150135, October30, 2006). Hence, the spouses may be authorized to litigate as indigents if the court, upon an ex parte application and hearing, is satisfied that they do , not have money or property sufficient and available for food, shelter, and basic necessities for themselves and their family (Rule 3, Sec. 21 Rules of Court; Re: Query of Mr. Roger Prioreschi, A.M. No. 09-6-9-SC August 19, 2009). 2. The Spouses can also file a motion to sue as indigent under the Rules of Procedure on Small Claims. The Motion shall be referred to the Executive Judge for immediate action in case of multi-sala courts. If the motion is granted by the Executive Judge, the case shall be raffled off or assigned to the court designated to hear small claims cases. If the motion is denied, the plaintiff shall be given five (5) days within, which to pay the docket fees, otherwise, the case shall be dismissed without prejudice. In no case shall a party, even if declared an indigent, be exempt from the payment of the P1,000.00 fee for service of summons and processes (Section 10, A.M. No. 08-8-7-SC, 2016 Rules of Procedure for Small Claims Cases). 3. The spouses may. also claim exemption from payment of legal fees by seeking the help of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines pursuant to AM. No. 08-11-7-SC (IRR), Rule on the Exemption From the Payment of Legal Fees of the Clients of the Notional Committee on Legal Aid of the Legal Aid Offices in the Local Chapters of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines"

Galaxy filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground of improper venue alleging that the complaint should be filed with the RTC of Makati since the complaint involves the ownership and possession of Eduardo’s lot. Resolve the motion with reasons. ",
        "Answer": "The Motion to dismiss should be granted. An action for nullification of the mortgage documents and foreclosure of the mortgaged property is a real action that affects the title to the property; thus, venue of the real action is before the court having jurisdiction over the territory in which the property lies (Jimmy T. Go v. United Coconut Planters Bank, GR. No. 156187, November 11, 2004; Chua v. Total Office Products & Services, G.R. No. 152808, September 30, 2005). In Fortune Motors v. Court of Appeals (ER. No. 112191, February 7,1997), The Supreme Court also held that an action to annul a foreclosure sale of a real estate mortgage is no different from an action to annul a private sale of real property. While it is true that petitioner does not directly seek the recovery of title or possession of the property in question, his action for annulment of sale and his claim for damages are closely intertwined with the issue of ownership of the building which, under the law, is considered immovable property, the recovery of which is petitioner’s primary objective. The prevalent doctrine is that an action for the annulment or rescission of a sale of real property does not operate to efface the fundamental and prime objective and nature of the case, which is to recover said real property. It is a real action (Paglaum Management & Development Corporation v. Union Bank of the Philippines, G.R. No.179018, June 18, 2012). Being a real action, it shall be commenced and tried in the proper court which has jurisdiction over the area where the real property involved, or a portion thereof, is situated (Section 1, Rule 4, Rules of Court). The complaint should be filed in the RTC of Makati where the mortgaged property is.situated."

        "Answer": "NO. The court was not correct in motu proprio dismissing the petition. While it appears that the alleged actionable neglect or omission took place in the City of Z of Province II and, therefore cognizable by the RTC of Province II, nonetheless, venue is not jurisdictional, and it can be waived in a special civil action for continuing mandamus (Dolot v.

Ten years before his retirement, he bought for cash in his name a house and lot in Malate, Manila. Six months after his return, he learned that his house and lot were the subject of foreclosure proceedings commenced by ABC Bank on the basis of a promissory note and a deed of real estate mortgage he had allegedly executed in favor of ABC Bank five years earlier. Knowing that he was not in the country at the time the promissory note and deed of mortgage were supposedly executed, Evan forthwith initiated a complaint in the RTC of Manila praying that the subject documents be declared null and void. ABC Bank filed a motion to dismiss Evan’s complaint on the ground of improper venue on the basis of a stipulation in both documents designating Quezon City as the exclusive venue in the event of litigation between the parties arising out of the loan and mortgage. Should the motion to dismiss of ABC Bank be granted? Explain your answer.  ",
        "Answer": "No. ABC Bank’s motion to dismiss should be denied. In Briones v. Court of Appeals (GR. No. 204444, January 14, 2015), the Supreme Court ruled that a complaint directly assailing the validity of the written instrument itself should not be bound by the exclusive venue stipulation contained therein and should be filed in accordance with the general rules on venue. The Supreme Court ruled that it would be inherently inconsistent for a complaint of this nature to recognize the exclusive venue stipulation when it, in fact, precisely assails the validity of the instrument in which such stipulation is contained. In this case, Evan’s complaint directly assails the validity of the promissory note and deed of mortgage, which contains said venue stipulation; hence, said venue stipulation is not binding on him. Evan correctly filed his complaint with the Manila RTC pursuant to Rule 4 of the Rules of Court."

Salvador promptly filed his answer, and included a counterclaim for P250,000.00 arising from the allegedly baseless and malicious claims of Abraham that compelled him to litigate and to engage the services of counsel, and thus caused him to suffer mental anguish. Noting that the amount of the counterclaim was below the exclusive original jurisdiction of the RTC, Abraham filed a motion to dismiss vis-a-vis the counterclaim on that ground. Should the counterclaim of Salvador be dismissed? Explain your answer. (4%) ",
        "Answer": "No, Salvador’s counterclaim is compulsory in nature, and thus should not be dismissed. Section 7, Rule 6 of the Rules of Court defines a compulsory counterclaim as any claim for money or any relief, which a defending party may have against an opposing party, which at the time of suit arises out of, or is necessarily connected with, the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff’s complaint (Rungcayao v. Fort Ilocandia, G.R. No. 170483, April 19,2010). A counterclaim is compulsory where: 1. It arises out of or is necessarily connected with the transaction or occurrence that is the subject flatter of the opposing party’s claim; 2. It does not require the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction, and; 3. The trial court has jurisdiction to entertain the claim (Spouses Arenas v. CA, G.R. No. 126640, November 23, 2000). Regarding the trial court’s jurisdiction, Section 7, Rule 6 of the Rules of Court explicitly states that in an original action before the Regional Trial Court, the counterclaim may be considered compulsory regardless of the amount. In relation thereto, the Supreme Court held in Alday v. FGU Insurance Corp. (G.R, No. 138822, January 23, 2001), that claims for damages, allegedly suffered as a result of plaintiff’s filing of a complaint, are compulsory. In this case, the court’s jurisdiction over Salvador’s counterclaim, despite being below the jurisdictional amount is evident from the following: Salvador’s claims for litigation expenses arise out of Abraham’s complaint for damages; Salvador’s claims do not require the presence of third parties; and being compulsory in nature, the trial court may exercise jurisdiction over said claim."

He used a makeshift hut in a vacant lot near the local courts and a local transport regulatory agency. With this practice and location, he did not have big-time clients but enjoyed heavy patronage assisting walk-in clients.  a) What role can Attorney Novato play in small claims cases when lawyers are not allowed to appear as counsel in these cases?",
        "Answer": "Atty. Novato may only give counseling and assist claimants in accomplishing the Statement of Claims and the Affidavits necessary to initiate a small claims action. He can also notarize the aforementioned documents since the statement of Claims and Response are required to be verified (Sec. 7, Rules of Procedure for Small Claims, A.M. No. 8-8-7 SC)."

        "Question": "Tailors Toto, Nelson and Yenyen filed a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 from an adverse decision of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) on the complaint for illegal dismissal against Empire Textile Corporation. They were terminated on the ground that they failed to meet the prescribed production quota at least four (4) times. The NLRC decision was assailed in a special civil action under Rule 65 before the Court of Appeals (CA). In the verification and certification against forum shopping, only Toto signed the verification and certification, while Atty. Arman signed for Nelson. Empire filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of defective verification and certification. Decide with reasons. ",
        "Answer": "The motion to dismiss on the ground of defective verification should be denied. The Supreme Court has held that a lawyer may verify a pleading in behalf of the client. Moreover a verification is merely a formal and not a jurisdictional requirement. The court should not dismiss the case but merely require the party concerned to rectify the defect. The motion to dismiss on the ground of defective certification against forum-shopping should likewise be denied. Under reasonable or justifiable circumstances, as when all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of action or defense, the signature of only one of them in the certification against forum shopping substantially complies with the Rule. (Jacinto v. Gumaru, 2 June 2014). In this case, the petitioners have a common interest and invoke a common cause of action, that is, their illegal dismissal by Empire Textile Corporation for failure to meet production quotas."

        "Question": "Mr. Humpty file with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) a complaint against Ms. Dumpty for damages. The RTC, after due proceedings, rendered a decision granting the complaint and ordering Ms. Dumpty to pay damages to Mr. Humpty. Ms. Dumpty timely filed an appeal before the Court of Appeals (CA), questioning the RTC decision. Meanwhile, the RTC granted Mr. Humpty’s motion for execution pending appeal. Upon receipt of the RTC’s order granting execution pending appeal, Ms. Dumpty filed with the CA another case, this time a special civil action for certiorari assailing said RTC order. Is there a violation of the rule against forum shopping considering that two (2) actions emanating from the same case with the RTC were filed by Ms. Dumpty with the CA? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "NO. There is no violation of the rule against forum shopping. The essence of forum shopping is the filing by a party against whom an adverse judgment has been rendered in one forum, seeking another and possibly favorable opinion in another suit other than by appeal or special civil action for certiorari; the act of filing of multiple suits involving the same parties for the same cause of action, either simultaneously or successively for the purpose of obtaining a favorable judgment. Forum shopping exists where the elements of litis pendentia are present or where a final judgment in one case will amount to res judicata in the action under consideration (Roberto S. Benedicto v. Manuel Laeson, G.R. No. 141508, May 5, 2010). In Philippines Nails and Wires Corporation v. Malayan Insurance Company, Inc., G.R. No. 143933, February 14, 2003, the Supreme Court held that one party may validly question a decision in a regular appeal and at the same time assail the execution pending appeal via certiorari without violating the rule against forum shopping. This is because the merits of the case will not be addressed in the Petition dealing with the execution and vice versa. Since Ms. Dumpty merely filed a special civil action for certiorari, the same will not constitute a violation of the rules on forum shopping because the resolution or a favorable judgment thereon will not amount to res judicata in the subsequent proceedings between the same parties. (Roberto S. Benedicto v. Manuel Laeson, G.R. No. 141508, May 5, 2010)."

Tomas, Batangas. The subject property, located in Barangay Talisay, Lipa City, has an assessed value of P19,700.00. Appended to the complaint is Amorsolo’s verification and certification of non-forum shopping executed in New York City, duly notarized by Mr. Joseph Brown, Esq., a notary public in the State of New York. Brigido filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the following grounds: x x x The verification and certification of non-forum shopping are fatally defective because there is no accompanying certification issued by the Philippine Consulate in New York, authenticating that^Mr. Brown is duly authorized to notarize the document.

        "Answer": "The third ground raised questioning the validity of the verification and certification of non- forum shopping for lack of certification from the Philippine Consulate in New York, authenticating that Mr. Brown is duly authorized to notarize the document, is likewise without merit. The required certification alluded to, pertains to official acts, or records of official bodies, tribunals, and public officers, whether of the Philippines or of a foreign country: the requirement in Sec. 24, Rule 132 of the 1997 Rules refers only to paragraph (a) of Sec. 29 which does not cover notarial documents.

        "Question": "On the basis of an alleged promissory note executed by Harold in favor of Ramon, the latter filed a complaint for P950,000.00 against the former in the RTC of Davao City. In an unverified answer, Harold specifically denied the genuineness of the promissory note. During the trial, Harold sought to offer the testimonies of the following: (1) the testimony of an NBI handwriting expert to prove the forgery of his signature; and (2) the testimony of a credible witness to prove that if ever Harold had executed the note in favor of Ramon, the same was not supported by a consideration. May Ramon validly object to the proposed testimonies? Give a brief explanation of your answer.  ",
        "Answer": "Ramon may validly object to the proposed testimony of the NBI handwriting expert. The alleged promissory note attached to Ramon’s complaint is an actionable document since it is a written instrument upon which an action or defense is grounded (Asian Construction and Development Corporation v. Mendoza, G.R. No. 176949, June 27, 2012). Accordingly, Harold’s failure to specifically deny under oath the genuineness of said actionable document amounts to an implied admission of its genuineness and due execution under Rule 8, Section 8 of the Rules of Court. Harold cannot thus raise the defense of forgery by presenting the testimony of a handwriting expert. Well-settled is the rule that the trial court may reject evidence that a party adduces to contradict a judicial admission he previously made since such admission is conclusive as to him (Equitable Card Network Inc., v. Capistrano, G.R. No. 180157, February 8, 2012). However, Ramon may not validly object to the testimony of a credible witness to prove that the promissory note was not supported by a consideration. The admission of the genuineness and due execution of a document does not bar the defense of want of a consideration (Hibberd v. Rohde and McMillan, G.R. No, L-8414, December 9, 1915)."

At the pre-trial conference, B Lines defined as one of the issues whether the stipulation limiting its liability to P10, 000 binds A. A countered that this was no longer in issue 11.S B Lines had jailed to deny under oath the Bill of Lading. Which of the parties is correct? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "The Contention of B is correct: A’s contention is wrong. It was A who pleaded the Bill of Lading as an actionable document where the stipulation limits B’s liability to A to P10, 000.00 only. The issue raised by B does not go against or impugn the genuineness and due execution of the Bill of Lading as an actionable document pleaded by A, but invokes the binding effect of said stipulation. The oath is not required of B, because the issue raised by the latter does not impugn the genuineness and due execution of the Bill of Lading."

        "Question": "Modesto sued Ernesto for a sum of money, claiming that the latter owed him PI- million, evidenced by a promissory note, quoted and attached to the complaint. In his answer with counterclaim, Ernesto alleged that Modesto coerced him into signing the promissory note, but that it is Modesto who really owes him PL5- million. Modesto filed an answer to Ernesto’s counterclaim admitting that he owed Ernesto, but only in the amount of PO.5-million. At the pretrial, Modesto marked and identified Ernesto’s promissory note. He also marked and identified receipts covering payments he made to Ernesto, to the extent of PO.5-million, which Ernesto did not dispute. After pre-trial, Modesto filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, while Ernesto filed a motion for summary judgment on his counterclaim. Resolve the two motions with reasons. ",
        "Answer": "Modesto’s motion for judgment on the pleadings should be denied. While it is true that under the actionable document rule, Ernesto’s failure to deny under oath the promissory note in his answer amounted to an implied admission of its genuineness and due execution, his allegation in his answer that he was coerced into signing the promissory note tendered an issue which should be tried. The issue of coercion is not inconsistent with the due execution and genuineness of the instrument. Thus, Ernesto’s failure to deny the genuineness of the promissory note cannot be considered a waiver to raise the issue that he was coerced in signing the same. Said claim of coercion may also be proved as an exception to the Parol Evidence Rule. On the other hand, Ernesto’s motion for summary judgment may be granted. Modesto’s answer to Ernesto’s counterclaim — that he owed the latter a sum less than what was claimed — amounted to an admission of a material fact and if the amount thereof could summarily be proved by affidavits, deposition, etc., without the need of going to trial, then no genuine issue of fact exists."

        "Question": "Circe filed with the RTC a complaint for the foreclosure of real estate mortgage against siblings Scylla and Charybdis, co-owners of the property and co-signatories to the mortgage deed. The siblings permanently reside in Athens, Greece. Circe tipped off Sheriff Pluto that Scylla is on a ballkbayan trip and is billeted at the Century Plaza Hotel in Pasay City. Sheriff Pluto went to the hotel and personally served Scylla the summons, but the latter refused to receive summons for Charybdis as she was not authorized to do so. Sheriff Pluto requested Scylla for the email address and fax number of Charybdis which the latter readily gave. Sheriff Pluto, in his return of the summons, stated that \"Summons for Scylla was served personally as shown by her signature on the receiving copy of the summons. Summons on Charybdis was served pursuant to the amendment of Rule 14 by facsimile transmittal of the summons and complaint on defendant's fax number as evidenced by transmission verification report automatically generated by the fax machine indicating that it was received by the fax number to which it was sent on the date and time indicated therein.\" Circe, sixty (60) days after her receipt of Sheriff Pluto's return, filed a Motion to Declare Charybdis in default as Charybdis did not file any responsive pleading.  a. Should the court declare Charybdis in default?",
        "Answer": "NO, the court should not declare Charybdis in default because there was no proper service of summons. Section 12, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court applies only to a foreign private juridical entity that is not registered in the Philippines and has no resident agent in the country, and not to individuals (A.M. No. 11-3-6-SC, March 15, 2011). The service of summons by facsimile under said rule is, therefore, defective. A foreclosure of real estate mortgage is a quasi in rem action, thus, the court can render judgments as long as it has jurisdiction over the res and any of the modes of extra- territorial service of summons under Section 15 of Rule 14 is complied with prior leave of court. There is, unfortunately, no showing in the problem that a prior leave of court was obtained before resorting to extra-territorial service of summons; hence, the service of summons is defective."

(B) No, because MCM has no juridical personality and cannot be sued. (C) No, since the real parties in interest, the owners of MCM Theater, have not been served with summons. (D) Yes since MCM, as business entity, is a de facto partnership with juridical personality.",

        "Answer": "No, there was no valid service of summons in this case, since the summons was not personally received by Buboy. For substituted service of summons to be available, there must be several attempts by the sheriff to personally serve the summons within a reasonable period. \"Several attempts: means at least three tries, preferably on at least two different dates\" (Mancha. v.

Explain your answer briefly .",
        "Answer": "No, the filing of the motion to dismiss, assailing the jurisdiction of the court over his person, together with other grounds raised therein, is not a voluntary submission to the court's jurisdiction (Garcia v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 170122, October 12, 2009). Under Section 20, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court, the defendant's voluntary appearance in the action shall be equivalent to service of summons. The inclusion in a motion to dismiss on other grounds aside from lack of jurisdiction over the person of the defendant shall not be deemed a voluntary appearance. The filing of a motion is deemed voluntary submission to the court's jurisdiction only when it constitutes an unqualified voluntary appearance before the court, such that the defendant failed to object to the court's jurisdiction over his person (PVIB v. Spouses Dy, G.R. No. 171137, June 5, 2009)."

Juan engaged the service of Sheriff Matinik to serve the summons but when the latter went to the residence of Roberto, he was told by the caretaker thereof that his employer no longer resides at the house. The caretaker is a high school graduate and is the godson of Roberto. Believing the caretaker's story to be true, Sheriff Matinik left a copy of the summons and complaint with the caretaker. Was there a valid substituted service of summons? Discuss the requirements for a valid service of summons. ",
        "Answer": "No. There was no valid substituted service of summons. In an action strictly in personam, personal service on the defendant is the preferred mode of service, that is, by handing a copy of the summons to the defendant in person. If defendant for excusable reasons, cannot be served with the summons within a reasonable period, then substituted service can be resorted to. While substituted service of summons is permitted, it is extraordinary in character and in derogation of the usual method of service; hence, it must faithfully and strictly comply with the prescribed requirements and circumstances authorized by the rules. Compliance with the rules regarding the service of summons is as important as the issue of due process for the Court to acquire jurisdiction. For the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty to apply, the Sheriff’s Return must show that serious efforts or attempts were exerted to personally serve the summons and that said efforts failed. These facts must be Specifically narrated in the Return. It must clearly show that the substituted service must be made on a person of suitable age and discretion living in the dwelling or residence of defendant; otherwise, the Return is flawed and the presumption cannot be availed of. The Supreme Court laid down the requirements as follows: Impossibility of prompt personal service, i.e., the party relying on substituted service or the sheriff must show that defendant cannot be served promptly or there is impossibility of prompt service within a reasonable time. Reasonable time being \"so much time as is necessary under the circumstances for a reasonably prudent and diligent man to do, conveniently, what the contract or duty requires that should be done, having a regard for the rights and possibility of loss, if any to the other party\". Moreover, it must be indicated therein that the sheriff has made several attempts at personal service for at least three (3) times on at least two (2) different dates. Specific details in the return, i.e., the sheriff must describe in the Return of Summons the facts and circumstances surrounding their attempted personal service. Substituted service effected on a person of suitable age and discretion residing at defendant's house or residence; or on a competent person in charge of defendant's office or regular place of business (Ma.

The complaint alleges that Charlie borrowed the amount from Alfie and duly executed a promissory note as evidence of the loan. Charlie’s office secretary, Esther, received the summons at Charlie’s office. Charlie failed to file an answer within the required period, and Alfie moved to declare Charlie in default and to be allowed to present evidence ex parte. Ten days later, Charlie filed his verified answer, raising the defense of full payment with interest.  a) Was there proper and valid service of summons on Charlie?",
        "Answer": "NO. There is no showing that earnest efforts were exerted to personally serve the summons on the defendant before substituted service was resoted to; the service of sumoons was improper. In an action strictly in personam like a complaint for sum of money, personal service on the defendant is the preferred mode of service, that is, by handing a copy of the summons to the defendant in person. If defendant, for excusable reasons, cannot be served with summons within a reasonable period, then substituted service can be resorted to (Manotoc v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 130974, August 16, 2006). Otherwise stated, it is only when the defendant cannot be served personally within a reasonable time that a substituted service may be made. Impossibility of prompt service should be shown by stating the efforts made to find the defendant personally and the fact that such efforts failed. This statement should be made in the proof of service (Galura v. Math-Agro Corporation, G.R. No. 167230, August 14, 2009). Since there was no prior attempt to serve the summons in person, the substituted service to Charlie’s secretary is invalid."

The complaint alleged that \"on account Arthur King's residence abroad up to the present and the uncertainty of whether he is still alive or dead, he or his estate may be served with summons by publication.\" Summons was published and nobody filed any responsive pleading within sixty (60) days therefrom. Upon motion, defendants were declared in default and judgment was rendered declaring Tristan as legal owner and ordering defendants to reconvey said lot to Tristan. Jojo, the court-designated administrator of Arthur King's estate, filed a petition for annulment of judgment before the CA praying that the decision in favor of Tristan be declared null and void for lack of jurisdiction. He claims that the action filed by Tristan is an action in personam and that the court did not acquire jurisdiction over defendants Arthur King and/or his estate. On the other hand, Tristan claims that the suit is an action in rem or at least an action quasi in rem. Is the RTC judge correct in ordering service of summons by publication? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "Yes, the RTC judge is correct in ordering service of summons by publication. Under Section 15 Rule 14 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, extraterritorial service, which includes service by publication, may be availed of in actions the subject of which is property within the Philippines in which the defendant has or claims a lien or interest or in which the relief demanded consists in excluding the defendant from any interest therein. In this case, the action for reconveyance has for its subject a real property in the Philippines in the defendant’s name and in which the relief sought is to annul the defendant’s title and vest it in the plaintiff. Although the action for reconveyance is in personam (Republic v. CA, 315 SCRA 600, 606), the test of whether an action is covered by Section 15 Rule 14 is not its technical characterization as in rem or quasi in rem but whether it is among those mentioned in S15 R14.

Realizing a jurisdictional error in filing the complaint in the RTC, Agatha filed a notice of dismissal before she was served with the answer of Yana. The RTC issued an order confirming the dismissal. Three months later, Agatha filed another complaint against Yana based on the same cause of action this time in the MeTC of Makati City. However, for reasons personal to her, Agatha decided to have the complaint dismissed without prejudice by filing a notice of dismissal prior to the service of the answer of Yana.

May Yana successfully invoke the Two-Dismissal Rule to bar Agatha's third complaint? Explain your answer.  ",
        "Answer": "No, Yana cannot successfully invoke the Two-Dismissal Rule. In order for the Two-Dismissal Rule to apply, Rule 17, Section 1 of the Rules of Court requires that both dismissals through plaintiff's notices were made by a competent court. Moreover, in Ching Cheng (G.R. No. 175507, October 8, 2014), the Supreme Court ruled that the following requisites should concur for the Two-Dismissal Rule to apply: a. There was a previous case that was dismissed by a competent court; b. Both cases were based on or include the same claim; c. Both notices for dismissal were filed by the plaintiff; and d. When the motion to dismiss filed by the plaintiff was consented to by the defendant on the ground that the latter paid and satisfied all the claims of the former. In this case, the Makati City RTC had no jurisdiction over the first complaint which was dismissed through Agatha's notice, because it is below its jurisdictional amount of at least P400,000.00.

        "Question": "Antique dealer Mercedes borrowed P1, 000,000 from antique collector Benjamin. Mercedes issued a postdated check in the same amount to Benjamin to cover the debt. On the due date of the check, Benjamin deposited it but it was dishonored. As despite demands, Mercedes failed to make good the check, Benjamin filed in January 2009 a complaint for collection of sum of money before the RTC of Dayao. Mercedes filed in February 2009 her Answer with Counterclaim, alleging that before the filing of the case, she and Benjamin had entered into a dacion enpago agreement in which her vintage P1, 000,000 Rolex watch which was taken by Benjamin for sale on commission was applied to settle her indebtedness; and that she incurred expenses in defending what she termed a \"frivolous lawsuit.. She accordingly prayed for P50, 000 damages. A. Benjamin soon after moved for the dismissal of the case. The trial court accordingly dismissed the complaint. And it also dismissed the Counterclaim. Mercedes moved for a reconsideration of the dismissal of the Counterclaim. Pass upon Mercedes' motion. (2010 Bar Question)",
        "Answer": "Mercedes' Motion for Reconsideration is impressed with merit: the trial court should not have dismissed her counter-claim despite the dismissal of the Complaint. Since it was the plaintiff (Benjamin) who moved for the dismissal of his Complaint, and at a time when the defendant (Mercedes) had already filed her Answer thereto and with counterclaim, the .dismissal of the Complaint should not carry with it the dismissal of the counterclaim without the conformity of the defendant-counterclaimant. The Revised Rules of Court now provides in Rule 17, Sec. 2 there or that \"[1]a counterclaim has been pleaded by a defendant prior to the service upon him of the plaintiff's motion for dismissal, the dismissal shall be limited to the complaint. The dismissal shall be without prejudice to the right of the defendant to prosecute his counterclaim x x x.\""

Water Builders failed to complete the project within the stipulated duration. Super Powers cancelled the contract. Water Builders filed a request for arbitration with the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC). After due proceedings, CIAC rendered judgment in favor of Super Powers, Inc. ordering Water Builders to pay the former P 10 million, the full amount of the down payment paid, and P2 million by way of liquidated damages. Dissatisfied with the CIAC's judgment, Water Builders, pursuant to the Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR Rules) filed with the RTC of Pasay City a petition to vacate the arbitral award.

        "Answer": "The motion may be denied since trial had already commenced and two witnesses for the plaintiff had already testified. Courts are required to issue pre-trial Order after the pre-trial conference has been terminated and before trial begins, precisely because the reason for such Order is to define the course of the action during the trial. Where trial had already commenced, more so the adverse party had already presented witnesses, to allow an amendment would be unfair to the party who had already presented his witnesses. The amendment would simply render nugatory the reason for or purpose of the pre-trial Order.

When it appears, however, that not all the material allegations of the complaint were admitted in the answer, because some of them were either denied or disputed, and the defendant has set up certain special defenses which, if proven, would have the effect of nullifying plaintiff's main cause of action, judgment on the pleadings cannot be rendered (Philippine National bank v.

For a summary judgment to be proper, the movant must establish two requisites: (a) there must be no genuine issue as to any material fact, except for the amount of damages; and (b) the party presenting the motion for summary judgment must be entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. A genuine issue is an issue of fact which requires the presentation of evidence as distinguished from an issue which is sham, fictitious, contrived or false claim. Relative thereto, when the facts pleaded by the parties are disputed or contested, proceedings for a summary judgment cannot take place of a trial. The evidence on record must be viewed in light most favourable to the party opposing the motion who must be given the benefit of all favourable inferences as can reasonably be drawn from the evidence (Smart Communications v. Aldecoa, G.R. No. 166330, September 11, 2013)."

In his answer, defendant alleged that he had no interest over the land in question, except as lessee of Z. Plaintiff subsequently filed an affidavit of Z, the lessor of defendant, stating that Z had sold to plaintiff all his rights and interests in the property as shown by a deed of transfer attached to the affidavit.

The notice of appeal shall be filed with the RTC which rendered the judgment appealed from and copy thereof shall be served upon the adverse party within 15 days from notice of judgment or final order appealed from. But if the case admits of multiple appeals or is a special proceeding, a record on appeal is required aside from the written notice of appeal to perfect the appeal, in which case the period for appeal and notice upon the adverse party is not only 15 days but 30 days from notice of judgment or final order appealed from. The full amount of the appellate court docket fee and other lawful fees required must also be paid within the period for taking an appeal, to the clerk of the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from (Secs. 4 and 5, Rule 41, Rules of Court). The periods of 15 or 30 days above-stated are non-extendible.

Before filing the petition, Tom Wallis had told Debi Wallis that he wanted the annulment of their marriage because he was already fed up with her irrational and eccentric behaviour. However, in the petition for declaration of nullity of marriage, the correct residential address of Debi Wallis was deliberately not alleged and instead, the resident address of their married son was stated. Summons was served by served by substituted service at the address stated in the petition. For failure to file an answer, Debi Wallis was declared in default and Tom Wallis presented evidence ex-parte. The RTC rendered judgment declaring the marriage null and void on the ground of psychological incapacity of Debi Wallis. Three (3) years after the RTC judgment was rendered, Debi Wallis got hold of a copy thereof and wanted to have the RTC judgment reversed and set aside. If you are the lawyer of Debi Wallis, what judicial remedy or remedies will you take? Discuss and specify the ground or grounds for said remedy or remedies. ",
        "Answer": "Debi Wallis may file a Petition for Annulment of Judgment under Rule 47 of the Rules of Court, on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction, extrinsic fraud and denial of the right to due process (Leticia Diona v. Romeo Balange, G.R. No. 173589, January 7, 2013). An action for annulment of judgment is a remedy in law independent of the case where the judgment sought to be annulled was rendered. The purpose of such action is to have the final and executory judgment set aside so that there will be a renewal of litigation. It is resorted to in cases where the ordinary remedies of new trial, appeal, petition for relief from judgment, or other appropriate remedies are no longer available through no fault of the appellant and is base on the grounds of extrinsic fraud, and lack of jurisdiction (Aleban v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 156021, September 23, 2005). Relative thereto, the act of Tom Wallis in deliberately keeping Debi Wallis away from the Court, by intentionally alleging a wrong address in the complaint constitutes extrinsic fraud. Moreover, the failure of the Court to acquire jurisdiction over the person of the respondent, being an indispensable party, necessitates the annulment of judgment of the Regional Trial Court. Likewise, there is denial of the right to due process when Debi Wallis was not given an opportunity to be heard in the case. Hence, the judgment rendered by the RTC may be annulled by the Court of Appeals under Rule 47 of the Rules of Court. Moreover, it is evident that the ordinary remedies of new trial, petition for relief or other appropriate remedies are no longer available through no fault of Debi Wallis because she was able to obtain a copy of the Decision only three (3) years after the same was rendered by the Trial Court. At any rate, the Court erred in declaring the defendant in default because there is no default in a Petition for declaration of nullity of marriage (Sec. 3, Rule 9). Thus, a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court could have been an appropriate remedy within the reglementary period allowed by the Rules."

During the effectivity of her suspension, Janet appointed her as attorney-in-fact in an execution sale arising from a civil case that she previously handled. At the execution sale, Atty. Irish took part in the bidding and negotiations as regards the payment of the judgment award. Atty. Elvie, the opposing counsel in the civil case, questioned the appearance by Atty. Irish during the execution sale because of her suspension. Atty. Irish argued that she was merely acting as attorney-in-fact of Janet, which was not tantamount to the practice of law. Do you agree with Atty. Irish? Explain your answer.",
  "Answer": "No, I do not agree with Atty. Irish. While the practice of law is generally defined as any activity in or out of court which requires the application of law, legal procedure, knowledge, training, and experience, the enumeration of prohibited practices during suspension is expanded. The appearance of Atty. Irish as attorney-in-fact during the execution sale, taking part in the bidding and negotiations, constitutes an activity that requires the use of legal knowledge, training, and experience, and is thus considered practicing law.

Eventually, the injunction case was dismissed with finality by Judge T, and an entry of judgment was issued. Two (2) years later, Judge T bought condominium units in the same 40-storey building owned by XYZ Corp. Did Judge T commit an ethical violation? Explain.",
  "Answer": "No, Judge T did not commit an ethical violation. Article 1491 of the Civil Code prohibits judges from acquiring property that is the subject of litigation, but the prohibition applies only if the property is acquired during the pendency of the litigation. Since Judge T acquired the condominium units two years after the case was dismissed with finality and an entry of judgment was issued, the prohibition does not apply."

  "Answer": "Compulsory prohibition (or inhibition) - A judge cannot sit in any case where he, his wife, or child, is pecuniarily interested as heir, legatee, creditor, or otherwise, or is related to either party within the sixth degree of consanguinity or affinity, or to counsel within the fourth degree, or in which he has been executor, administrator, guardian, trustee or counsel, or in which he has presided in any inferior court when his ruling is the subject of review.

More importantly, the questions of the justices were in the nature of cross-examinations characteristic of confrontation, probing, and insinuation. Is this manner of questioning proper? ",
  "Answer": "No, this manner of questioning is not proper. Although a trial judge has the right to question witnesses to clarify material points, this right should be sparingly and judiciously used.

The Court, however, found that Ciguerra’s FB account did not have privacy settings. Can Ciguerra be disbarred for the series of posts in his FB account against Dr. Cielo?",
  "Answer": "Yes, Ciguerra can be disbarred. A lawyer is bound to observe proper decorum at all times, be it in his public or private life. He must behave in a manner befitting an officer of the court. The words used were unbecoming of an officer of the law. His defense regarding privacy is invalid, especially since his account lacked privacy settings, making his posts accessible to the public."

        "Question": "With the passage of time, the members of the House of Representatives increased with the creation of new legislative districts and the corresponding adjustments in the number of party-list representatives. At a time when the House membership was already 290, a great number of the members decided that it was time to propose amendments to the Constitution. The Senators, however, were cool to the idea. But the members of the House insisted. They accordingly convened Congress into a constituent assembly in spite of the opposition of the majority of the members of the Senate. When the votes were counted, 275 members of the House of Representatives approved the proposed amendments. Only 10 Senators supported such proposals. The proponents now claim that the proposals were validly made, since more than the required three-fourths vote of Congress has been obtained. The 14 Senators who voted against the proposals claim that the proposals needed not three-fourths vote of the entire Congress but each house. Since the required number of votes in the Senate was not obtained, then there could be no valid proposals, so argued the Senators. Were the proposals validly adopted by Congress? ",
        "Answer": "The proposal were not validly adopted, because the ten (10) Senators who voted in favor of the proposed amendments constituted less than three-fourths of all the Members of the Senate. Although Section 1, Article XVII of the Constitution did not expressly provide that the Senate and the House of Representatives must vote separately, when the Legislature consist of two (2) houses, the determination of one house is to be submitted to the separate determination of the other house."

        "Question": "(1) A bill was introduced in the House of Representatives in order to implement faithfully the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to which the Philippines is a signatory. Congressman Pat Rio Tek questioned the constitutionality of the bill on the ground that the provisions of UNCLOS are violative of the provisions of the Constitution defining the Philippine internal waters and territorial sea. Do you agree or not with the said objection? Explain.  (2) Describe the following maritime regimes under UNCLOS  (a) Territorial sea (b) Contiguous zone (c) Exclusive economic zone (d) Continental shelf",
        "Answer": "(1) I do not agree. 'The UNCLOS is a product of international negotiation that seeks to balance State sovereignity (mare clausum) and the principle of freedom of the high seas (mare liberum). The freedom to use the world’s marine waters is one of the oldest customary principles of international law. The UNCLOS gives to the coastal State sovereign rights in varying degrees over the different zones of the sea which are: 1) internal waters, 2) territorial sea, 3) contiguous zone, 4) exclusive economic zone, and 5) the high seas. It also gives coastal States more or less jurisdiction over foreign vessels depending on where the vessel is located. Insofar as the internal waters and territorial sea is concerned, the Coastal State exercises sovereignty, subject to the UNCLOS and other rules of international law. Such sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as well as to its bed and subsoil.' UNCLOS III does not define the internal and territorial waters of states but merely 'prescribes the water-land ration, length and contour of baselines of archipelagic States like the Philippines.' 'UNCLOS III has nothing to do with the acquisition (or loss) of territory,' It is a multilateral treaty regulating, among others, sea-use rights over maritime zones (i.e., the territorial waters [12 nautical miles from the baselines], exclusive economic zone [200 nautical miles from the baselines]), and continental shelves that UNCLOS III delimits.' 'UNCLOS III and its ancillary baselines laws play no role in the acquisition, enlargement or, as petitioners claim, diminution of territory. Under traditional international law typology, States acquire (or conversely, lose) territory through occupation, accretion, cession and prescription, not by executing multilateral treaties on the regulations of sea-use rights or enacting statutes to comply with the treaty’s terms to delimit maritime zones and continental shelves. Territorial claims to land features are outside UNCLOS III, and are instead governed by the rules on general international law.' (2) Under the provisions of UNCLOS III- (a) The territorial waters of an archipelagic state shall extend up to 12 nautical miles from its baselines; (b) Its contiguous zone shall extend up to 24 nautical miles from its baselines; (c) Its exclusive economic zone shall extend up to 200 nautical miles from its baselines; while (d) Its continental shelf 'comprises the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance.'"

Is the petition meritorious? (6%)",
        "Answer": "No, the petition is not meritorious. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea has nothing to do with the acquisition or loss of territory. It merely regulates sea-use rights over maritime zones, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones, and continental shelves which it delimits. The Kalayaan Islands and the Scarborough Shoals are located at an appreciable distance from the nearest shoreline of the Philippines archipelago. A straight baseline loped around them from the nearest baseline will violate Article 47(3) and Article 47(2) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea III.

(B) Section 2 of RA 9522 declared the Kalayaan Island Group (KIG) and Scarborough Shoal as 'Regimes of Islands.' Professor Agaton contends that since the law did not enclose said islands, then the Philippines lost its sovereignty and jurisdiction over them. Is his contention correct? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "(A) By the term 'archipelagic doctrine of national territory' is meant that the islands and waters of the Philippine archipelago are unified in sovereignty, together with 'all the territories over which the Philippines has sovereignty or jurisdiction.' This archipelagic doctrine, so described under Article I of the Constitution, draws its rationale from the status of the whole archipelago in sovereignty by which under Part IV of the UNCLOS, the Philippines is defined as an Archipelagic State in Article 46, thus: a) archipelagic state means a State constituted wholly by one or more archipelagos and may include other islands; b) archipelago means a group of islands including parts of islands interconnecting Waters and other natural features which are so closely interrelated that such islands waters and other natural features form an intrinsic geographic, economic and political entity, or which historically have been regarded as such. As an archipelagic state, the national territory is implemented by drawing its 'straight archipelagic baselines.' pursuant to Article 47 of the UNCLOS which prescribes among its main elements, as follows: 1. By 'joining the outermost points of the outermost islands and drying reefs of the archipelago', including the main islands and an area in which the ratio of the area of the water to the land, including atolls, is between 1 to land 9 to 1. 2 Mainly, the length of such baselines 'shall not exceed 100 nautical lines...' 3 The drawing of such baselines shall not depart to any appreciable extent from the general configuration of the archipelago.' (B) The contention Prof. Agaton is not correct at all. 'Regime of islands is a concept provided in Article 121 of the UNCLOS. It is a definition of the island as 'a naturally formed area a land, surrounded by water which is above water at high tide.' On the other hand, this provision, is differentiated from 'rocks' which cannot sustain human habitation of their own. - The importance of the difference between a natural island and rock is that an island is provided with territorial sea, exclusive economic zone and continental shelf, whereas rocks have no exclusive economic zone and continental shelf. This is the difference by which RA 9522 introduced into the KIG and separately Panatag or Scarborough Shoal is an island. 'Regime of Islands', has no relevance to acquisition or loss of sovereignty. RA 9522 has the effect of possibly dividing the area in question into island and rocks, apparently to make clear for each the maritime zones involved in the definition of island or of rocks."

The Agreement binds CBM, for a defined fee, to maintain the Embassy’s elevators, air-conditioning units and electrical facilities. Section 10 of the Agreement provides that the Agreement shall be governed by Philippine laws and that any legal action shall be brought before the proper court of Makati. Kafiristan terminated the Agreement because CBM allegedly did not comply with their agreed maintenance standards. CBM contested the termination and filed a complaint against Kafiristan before the Regional Trial Court of Makati.

Under these facts, can the Embassy successfully invoke immunity from suit? (6%)",
        "Answer": "Yes, the Embassy can invoke immunity from suit. Section 10 of the Maintenance Agreement is not necessarily a waiver of sovereign immunity from suit. It was meant to apply in case the Republic of Kafiristan elects to sue in the local courts or waives its immunity by a subsequent act. The establishment of a diplomatic mission is a sovereign function. This encompasses its maintenance and upkeep. The Maintenance Agreement was in pursuit of a sovereign activity."

        "Question": "The LISS Liberty, a warship of the United States (U.S.), entered Philippine archipelagic waters on its way to Australia. Because of the negligence of the naval officials on board, the vessel ran aground off the island of Palawan, damaging coral reefs and other marine resources in the area. Officials of Palawan filed a suit for damages against the naval officials for their negligence, and against the U.S., based on Articles 30 and 31 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Article 31 provides that the Flag State shall bear international responsibility for any loss or damage to the Coastal State resulting from noncompliance by a warship with the laws and regulations of the coastal State concerning passage through the territorial sea. The U.S. Government raised the defenses that: (A) The Philippine courts cannot exercise jurisdiction over another sovereign State, including its warship and naval officials.  (B) The United States is not a signatory to UNCLOS and thus cannot be bound by its provisions.  Rule on the validity of the defenses raised by the U.S., with reasons.",
        "Answer": "The defenses raised by the U.S. Government are not valid. (A) This defense relies on sovereign immunity from suit as advanced by the U.S. Government. But the suit filed by the Officials of Palawan draws its strength from Article 30 and 31 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). However, the U.S. defense is defeated by the UNCLOS through the application of Article 32 which provides: 'With such exceptions as are contained in sub-section A and in Articles 30 and 37, nothing in this Convention affects the immunities of warships and other government ships operated for non-commercial purposes.' In reality the supreme relevance of Article 32 quoted above is actualized by quoting an existing U.S. government document sourced from Dispatch Supplement, Law of the Sea Convention: Letters of Transmittal and Submittal and Commentary, as follows: 'Article 32 provides, in effect that the only rules in the Convention derogating from the immunities of warships and government ships operated for non-government purposes are those found in Articles 17-26, 30 and 31.' (B) The U.S. Government turns to the defense that it is not bound by the UNCLOS for the reason that it is not a State Party or a signatory. However, to be bound by the principle, it does not have to be a party to a treaty or convention. If it has the normative status of a customary norm of international law, it is binding on all states. This appears to be the holding of the principle of immunity of warship in question, as upheld by the U.S. Government in the document cited above. It states from the UNCLOS, thus: 'The Convention protects and strengthens the key principle of sovereign immunity for war-ships...Although not a new concept, sovereign immunity is a principle or of vital importance to the United States. The Convention provides for a universally recognized formulation of this principle... Article 32 provides that, with such exceptions as are contained in subsection A and in Articles 30 and 31… nothing in the Convention affects the immunities of warships...'"

        "Answer": "The State may be sued, with its consent, either expressly or impliedly. Only Congress can give a written waiver of immunity from suit in the form of a law. If a government agency undertakes a proprietary function, It waives its Immunity from suit When the Philippines Tourism Authority entered into a contract for the construction of a golf course, it engaged in a proprietary function."

        "Question": "The doctrine of immunity from suit in favor of the State extends to public officials in the performance of their official duties. May such officials be sued nonetheless to prevent or to undo their oppressive or illegal acts, or to compel them to act? Explain your answer. ",
        "Answer": "Public officials may be sued if they acted oppressively or illegally in the performance of their duties. A suit against a public officer who acted illegally is not a suit against the state. A public official may be compelled to act through a writ of mandamus. The main objective of mandamus is to compel the performance of a ministerial duty on the part of the respondent official; however, the writ does not issue to control or review the exercise of discretion or to compel a course of conduct. The writ of prohibition can also be availed of, as it is an extraordinary writ which can be directed against a public officer ordering said officer to desist from further proceedings when said proceedings are without or in excess of said officer’s jurisdiction, or are accompanied with grave abuse of discretion. Lastly, a public officer is by law not immune from damages in his/her personal capacity for acts done in bad faith which, being outside the scope of his authority, are no longer protected by the mantle of immunity for official actions."

She had been living with a married man, not her husband, for the last fifteen (15) years. Administratively charged with immorality and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, she admits her live-in arrangement, but maintains that this conjugal understanding is in conformity with their religious beliefs. As members of the religious sect, Yahweh’s Observers, they had executed a Declaration of Pledging Faithfulness which has been confirmed and blessed by their Council of Elders. At the formal investigation of the administrative case, the Grand Elder of the sect affirmed Angelina’s testimony and attested to the sincerity of Angelina and her partner in the profession of their faith. If you were to judge this case, will you exonerate Angelina? Reasons. ",

Second, it has not been shown that the least intrusive means possible was used so that the free exercise of religion is not infringed any more than necessary."

        "Question": "Several concerned residents of the areas fronting Manila Bay, among them a group of students who are minors, filed a suit against the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA), the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), the Department of Health (DOH), the Department of Agriculture (DA), the Department of Education (DepEd), the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), and a number of other executive agencies, asking the court to order them to perform their duties relating to the cleanup, rehabilitation and protection of Manila Bay. The complaint alleges that the continued neglect by defendants and their failure to prevent and abate pollution in Manila Bay constitute a violation of the petitioners constitutional right to life, health and a balanced ecology. (B) In its decision which attained finality, the Court ordered the defendants to clean up, rehabilitate and sanitize Manila Bay within eighteen (18) months, and to submit to the Court periodic reports of their accomplishment, so that the Court can monitor and oversee the activities undertaken by the agencies in compliance with the Court's directives. Subsequently a resolution was issued extending the time periods within which the agencies should comply with the directives covered by the final decision. A view was raised that the Court’s continued intervention after the cases has been decided violates the doctrine separation of powers considering that the government agencies all belong to the Executive Department and are under the control of the President. Is this contention correct? Why or why not? .",
        "Answer": "The order of the Supreme Court to the defendants to clean up, rehabilitate and sanitize Manila Bay is an exercise of judicial power, because the execution of its decision is an integral part of its adjudicative function. Since the submission of periodic reports is needed to fully implement the decision, the Supreme Court can issue a continuing writ of mandamus to the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority until full compliance with its order is shown."

When completed, the site will be open, free of charge, to all religions, beliefs, and faiths, where each devotee or believer shall be accommodated and treated in a fair and equal manner, without distinction, favor, or prejudice. There will also be individual segments or zones in the area which can be used for the conduct of whatever rituals, services, sacraments, or ceremonials that may be required by the customs or practices of each particular religion. The President approved the bill, happy in the thought that this could start the healing process of our wounded country and encourage people of varied and often conflicting faiths to live together in harmony and in peace.

The Malampaya NGO contends that, the provision constitutes an undue delegation of legislative power since the phrase 'and for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President gives the President unbridled discretion to determine the purpose for which the funds will be used.

(B) Does the assailed portion of section 8 of PD 910 hurdle the two (2) tests? ",
        "Answer": "(A) The completeness test means that the law sets forth the policy to be executed, carried out or implemented by the delegate. The 'sufficient standard test' means the law lays down adequate guidelines or limitations to map out the boundaries of the authority of the delegate and prevent the delegate from running riot. The standard must specify the limits of the authority of the delegate, announce the legislative policy and identify the condition under which it is to be implemented. (B) The assailed portion of Presidential Decree No. 910 does not satisfy the two tests. The phrase and for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President' gives the President unbridled discretion to determine the purpose for which the funds will be used. An infrastructure is any basic facility needed by society. The power to determine what kind of infrastructure to prioritize and fund is a power to determine the purpose of the appropriation and is an undue delegation of the power to appropriate.

        "Question": "In the May 2013 elections, the Allied Workers’ Group of the Philippines (AWGP), representing land-based and sea-based workers in the Philippines and overseas, won in the party list congressional elections. Atty. Abling, a labor lawyer, is its nominee. As part of the party’s advocacy and services, Congressman Abling engages in labor counseling, particularly for local workers with claims against their employers and for those who need representation in collective bargaining negotiations with employers. When labor cases arise, AWGP enters its appearance in representation of the workers and the Congressman makes it a point to be there to accompany the workers, although a retained counsel also formally enters his appearance and is invariably there. Congressman Abling largely takes a passive role in the proceedings although he occasionally speaks to supplement the retained counsel’s statements. It is otherwise in CBA negotiations where he actively participates. Management lawyers, feeling aggrieved that a congressman should not actively participate before labor tribunals and before employers because of the influence a congressman can wield, filed a disbarment case against the Congressman before the Supreme Court for his violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility and for breach of trust, in relation particularly with the prohibitions on legislators under the Constitution. Is the cited ground for disbarment meritorious? (6%)",
        "Answer": "Being a congressman, Atty. Abling is disqualified under Article VI, Section 14 of the 1987 Constitution from personally appearing as counsel before quasi-judicial and other administrative bodies handling labor cases constitutes personal appearance before them. His involvement in collective bargaining, negotiations also involves practice of law, because he is making use of his legal knowledge for the benefit of others. The Bureau of Labor Relations is involved in collective bargaining negotiations. Atty. Abling should not be disbarred but should be merely suspended from the practice of law. Suspension is the appropriate penalty for involvement in the unlawful practice of law."

A member of her political party authored a bill which would provide a 5-yeal development plan for all industrial estates in the Southern Tagalog Region to attract investors.

Section 12, Article VI of the Constitution does not prohibit the enactment of a law which will benefit the business interests of a member of the Senate or the House of Representatives. It only requires that if the member of Congress whose business interests will be benefited by the law is the one who will file the bill, he should notify the House concerned of the potential conflict of interest."

The Congress may not increase the appropriations recommended by the President for the operation of the Government as specified in the budget. The form, content, and manner of preparation of the budget shall be prescribed by law. No provision or enactment shall be embraced in the general appropriations bill unless it relates specifically to some particular appropriation therein. Any such provision or enactment shall be limited in its operation to the appropriation to which it relates. The procedure in approving appropriations for the Congress shall strictly follow the procedure for approving appropriations for other departments and agencies. A special appropriations bill shall specify the purpose for which it is intended, and shall be supported by funds actually available as certified by the National Treasurer, or to be raised by a corresponding revenue proposed therein. No law shall be passed authorizing any transfer of appropriations; however, the President, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the heads of Constitutional Commissions may, by law, be authorized to augment any item in the general appropriations law for their respective offices from savings in other items of their respective appropriations. Discretionary funds appropriated for particular officials shall. be disbursed only for public purposes to be supported .by appropriate vouchers and subject to such guidelines as may be prescribed by law. If, by the end of any fiscal year, the Congress shall have failed to pass the general appropriations bill for the ensuing fiscal year, the general appropriations law for the preceding fiscal year shall be deemed reenacted and shall remain in force and effect until the general appropriations bill is passed by the Congress."

His term of office started on June 2, 2011 to end on June 2, 2018. Subsequently, the President appointed Ms. Marikit as the third member of the COMELEC for a term of seven (7) years starting June 2, 2014 until June 2, 2021. On June 2, 2015, Chairperson Ty retired optionally after having served the government for thirty (30) years. The President then appointed Commissioner Marikit as COMELEC Chairperson. The Commission on Appointments confirmed her appointment. The appointment papers expressly indicate that Marikit will serve as COMELEC Chairperson 'until the expiration of the original term of her office as COMELEC Commissioner or on June 2, 2021.' Matalino, a tax payer, files a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court asserting that the appointment of Marikit as COMELEC Chairperson is unconstitutional for the following reasons: (1) The appointment of Marikit as COMELEC Chairperson constituted a reappointment which is proscribed by Section 1 (2), Article IX of the 1987 Constitution; and (2) the term of office expressly stated in the appointment papers of Marikit likewise contravenes the aforementioned constitutional provision. Will the constitutional challenge succeed? Explain.",
        "Answer": "The first argument is untenable since Commissioner Marikit was not reappointed but actually was a promotional appointment as she had not yet fully served her term. What the Constitution prohibits is a reappointment of a COMELEC Commissioner after serving the seven-year term. On the second argument, the limitation of the term of Commissioner Marikit as chairman until expiration of her original term on June 2, 2021 is valid only until June 8, 2018, that is, the unexpired portion of the last chairman’s term but invalid if until 2021 as it exceeds the limitation.

        "Question": "A law provides that the Secretaries of the Departments of Finance and Trade and Industry, the Governor of the Central Bank, the Director General of the National Economic Development Authority, and the Chairperson of the Philippine Overseas Construction Board shall sit as ex-officio members of the Board of Directors (BOD) of a government owned and controlled corporation (GOCC). The other four (4) members shall come from the private sector. The BOD issues a resolution to implement a new organizational structure, staffing pattern, a position classification system, and a new set of qualification standards. After the implementation of the Resolution, Atty. Dipasupil questioned the legality of the Resolution alleging that the BOD has no authority to do so. The BOD claims otherwise arguing that the doctrine of qualified political agency applies to the case. It contends that since its agency is attached to the Department of Finance, whose head, the Secretary of Finance, is an alter ego of the President, the BOD’s acts were also the acts of the President. Is the invocation of the doctrine by the BOD proper? Explain.",
        "Answer": "The invocation by the Board of directors of the doctrine of qualified political agency is not proper. 'The doctrine of qualified political agency essentially postulates that the heads of the various executive departments are the alter egos of the President, and, thus, the actions taken by such heads in the performance of their official duties are deemed the acts of the President unless the President himself should disapprove such acts. This doctrine is in recognition of the fact that in our presidential form of government, all executive organizations are adjuncts of a single Chief executive; that the heads of the executive Departments are assistants and agents of the Chief Executive; and that the multiple executive functions of the president as the Chief Executive are performed through the Executive Departments. The doctrine has been adopted here out of practical necessity, considering that the President cannot be expected to personally perform the multifarious functions of the executive office. The Cabinet Members sat on the Board of Directors ex officio, or by reason of their office or function, 'not because of their direct appointment to the Board by the president. Evidently, it was the law, not the President, that sat them in the Board.' 'Under the circumstances, when the members of the Board of Directors effected the assailed… reorganization, that were acting as the responsible members of the Board of Directors' constituted pursuant to the law,' not as the alter egos of the President.'"

        "Answer": "While both the power to declare a state of rebellion and the power to proclaim a state of national emergency may be justified under the President’s general Ordinance Powers under the provisions of the Administrative Code (Chapter 2, Book III of Executive Order No. 292 Administrative Code of 1987), the power to declare a state of rebellion springs from the President’s so called 'calling out power' under Section 18 of Article VII of the Constitution, which provides that 'whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion,' while the power to proclaim a state of national emergency can be said to be based primarily on his duty to enforce the laws as well as to formulate policies to be embodied in existing laws, consistent with the provisions of Section 17 of Article VII of the Constitution. Under said provision, the President 'sees to it that all laws are enforced by the officials and employees of his department.' Moreover, 'in the exercise of such function, the President, if needed, may employ the powers attached to this office as the Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the country, including the Philippine National Police under the Department of Interior and Local Government.' It must be noted though, that without a law promulgated pursuant to the provisions of Section 23(2) of Article VI, and Section 17 of Article XII, both of which authorize the statutory delegation of emergency powers in favor of the President, he is limited to the exercise of his calling-out power under Section 18 of Article VII of the Constitution, and may not exercise emergency powers."

After the Philippine President signed the agreement, the Philippine Senate demanded that the international agreement be submitted to it for its ratification. The President refused, arguing that it is an executive agreement that merely created an international organization and it dwells mainly on addressing economic issues among States. Is the international agreement creating the 1E0 a treaty or an executive agreement? Explain, ",
        "Answer": "The agreement creating the International Economic Organization (1E0) is an executive agreement and not a treaty. In Section 21, Article VII is the only provision of the Constitution which defines a 'treaty or international agreement' as valid and effective law by reason of concurrence of the Senate. However, it is the amendment of the Constitution that such 'treaty or international agreement' does not include executive agreement which therefore is excluded from the Senate's authority of concurrence over treaties. This constitutional intent is expressed in the proceedings of the Constitutional Commission in its awareness that at the time the power of the President to conclude executive agreement was clearly recognized by at least decisions of the Supreme court establishing the principle that the President’s power includes conclusion of executive agreements which are valid without need of Senate concurrence, Hence, logically the Treaty Clause in Section 21, Article VII is to be interpreted as excluding executive agreement. Moreover, as the Supreme Court has pointed out in Pimentel v. Office of the Executive Secretary, the President has the sole power to ratify treaties. The Senate may be able to exercise its authority of concurrence only if the President transmits the instrument of ratification by which he accepts the terms agreed on by his diplomatic negotiators of the proposed treaty in question, together with the text of the proposed treaty, with the request addressed to the Senate President to ratify such proposed treaty as requested by the President. It is only on the basis of the authority of the President to ratify treaties that the Senate may act in concurrence under the Treaty clause of the Constitution."

The invitees Brigadier General Matapang and Lieutenant Coronel Makatuwiran, who were among those tasked to maintain peace and order during the last election, refused to attend because of an Executive Order banning all public officials enumerated in paragraph 3 thereof from appearing before either house of Congress without prior approval of the President to ensure adherence to the rule of executive privilege.

        "Question": "The Court had adopted the practice of announcing its decision in important, controversial or interesting cases the moment the votes had been taken among the justices, even as the final printed decision and separate opinions are not yet available to the public. In a greatly anticipated decision in a case of wide-ranging ramifications, the voting was close - 8 for the majority, while 7 were for the other side. After the Court had thus voted, it issued a press release announcing the result, with the advice that the printed copy of the decision, together with the separate opinions, were to be issued subsequently. The following day, however, one of the members of the Court died. The Court then announced that it would deliberate anew on the case since apparently the one who died belonged to the majority. Citizens for Transparency, a group of civic-spirited professionals and ordinary citizens dedicated to transparency and accountability in the government, questioned the act of the Court. The petitioners claimed the decision had already been validly adopted and promulgated. Therefore, it could no longer be recalled by the Court. At the same time, the group also asked the Court to disclose to the public the original decision and the separate opinions of the magistrates, together with what they had deliberated on just before they came up with the press release about the 8-7 decision. (A) Was the announced 8-7 decision already validly promulgated and thus not subject to recall?",
        "Answer": "A. The decision cannot be deemed to have been promulgated simply because of the announcement of the voting in a press release, because the decision has not yet been issued and filled with the Clerk of Court. Until the decision is filed with the Clerk of Court, the Justices still have control over the decision and they can still change their votes."

        "Question": "Congress passed a law, R.A. No. 15005, creating an administrative Board principally tasked with the supervision and regulation of legal education. The Board was attached to the Department of Education. It was empowered, among others, to prescribe minimum standards for law admission and minimum qualifications of faculty members, the basic curricula for the course of study aligned to the requirements for admission to the Bar, law practice and social consciousness, as well as to establish a law practice internship as a requirement for taking the Bar which a law student shall undergo anytime during the law course, and to adopt a system of continuing legal education. Professor Boombas tick, a long-time law practitioner and lecturer in several prestigious law schools, assails the constitutionality of the law arguing that it encroached on the prerogatives of the Supreme Court to promulgate rules relative to admission to the practice of law, the Integrated Bar, and legal assistance to the underprivileged. If you were Professor Boombas tick’s understudy, how may you help him develop clear, concise and cogent arguments in support of his position based on the present Constitution and the decisions of the Supreme Court on judicial independence and fiscal autonomy? (2014 BAR)",
        "Answer": "The statutory authority granted to the administrative Board to promulgate rules and regulations cannot encroach upon the exclusive authority of the Supreme Court to regulate the admission to the practice of law. Thus, The Administrative Board cannot prescribe additional standards for admission to the practice of law, adopt a course study which is inconsistent with the requirements to take the bar examinations. Since Congress has no power to repeal, alter or supplement the Rules of Court, it cannot delegate such power to the Administrative Board."

Patricio, a user who was charged with alleged sale of shabu but who wants to enter a plea of guilty to a charge of possession, questions the constitutionality of Sec. 23 on the ground that Congress encroached on the rule-making power of the Supreme Court under Sec. 5, Article VIII. He argues that plea-bargaining is procedural in nature and is within the exclusive constitutional power of the Court. Is Patricio correct? Explain your answer. ",
        "Answer": "Patricio is not correct. Defining the penalty for a criminal offense involves the exercise of legislative power. When Section 23 of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act prohibited plea-bargaining, Congress defined what should be the penalty for the criminal offense. The power of the Supreme Court to promulgate rules of procedure is subject to the limitation that it should no modify substantive rights."

        "Question": "The President appoints Emilio Melchor as Chairperson of the Civil Service Commission. Upon confirmation of Melchor’s appointment, the President issues an executive order including him as Ex-Officio member of the Board of Trustees of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), Employees Compensation Commission (ECC), and the Board of Directors of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHILHEALTH). Allegedly, this is based on the Administrative Code of 1997 (E.O. No. 292), particularly Section 14, Chapter 3, Title I-A, Book V. This provision reads: 'The chairman of the CSC shall be a member of the Board of Directors of other governing bodies of government entities whose functions affect the career development, employment, status, rights, privileges, and welfare of government officials and employees... ' A taxpayer questions the designation of Melchor as ex-officio member of the said corporations before the Supreme Court based on two (2) grounds, to wit: (1) it violates the constitutional prohibition on members of the Constitutional Commissions to hold any other office or employment during his tenure; and (2) it impairs the independence of the CSC. Will the petition prosper? Explain. ",
        "Answer": "(1) The Chairperson Emilio Melchor’s holding ex-officio of the other offices under the Executive Order mentioned in the problem would constitute a clear violation of the special prohibition in Section 2 of Article IX-A of the Constitution, which strictly provides that he shall, during his tenure, not hold any other office or employment. Said constitutional provision does not make any distinction among the offices he may not hold, or as to whether or not the functions attached to said offices would be primarily related to his duties as Chairperson of the Civil Service Commission and therefore may be held in an ex-officio capacity. The GSIS, PHILHEALTH, ECC and HDMF are vested by their respective charters with various powers and functions to carry out the purposes for which they were created. While powers and functions associated with appointments, compensation and benefits affect the career development, employment status, rights, privileges, and welfare of government officials and employees, the GSIS, PHILHEALTH, ECC and HDMF are also tasked to perform other corporate powers and functions that are not personnel-related. All of these powers and functions, whether personnel-related or not, are carried out and exercised by the respective Boards of the GSIS, PHILHEALTH, ECC and HDMF. Hence, when the CSC Chairman sits as a member of the governing Boards of the GSIS, PHILHEALTH, ECC and HDMF, he may exercise these powers and functions, which are not anymore derived from his position as CSC Chairman, such as imposing interest on unpaid or unremitted contributions, issuing guidelines for the accreditation of health care providers, or approving restructuring proposals in the payment of unpaid loan amortizations. The CSC Chairman’s designation as a member of the governing Boards of the GSIS, PHILHEALTH, ECC and HDMF entitles him to receive per diem, a form of additional compensation that is disallowed by the concept of an ex officio position by virtue of its clear contravention of the proscription set by Section 2, Article IX-A of the 1987 Constitution. This situation goes against the principle behind an ex officio position, and must, therefore, be held unconstitutional. (1) Apart from violating the prohibition against holding multiple offices, Melchor’s designation as member of the governing Boards of the GSIS, PHILHEALTH, ECC and HDMF impairs the independence of the CSC. Under Section 17, Article VII of the Constitution, the President exercises control overall government offices in the Executive Branch. An office that is legally not under the control of the President is not part of the Executive Branch."

Is the argument of the professor valid? Explain. ",

Furnished with a copy of the complaint, Torre denied the charges. Two days later, the lawyers and Torre were called to a conference in the office of the Board Chairman to give their respective sides of the controversy. However, no agreement was reached thereat. Bank Director Romulo Moret was tasked to look further into the matter. He met with the lawyers together with Torre several times but to no avail. Moret then submitted a report sus-taining the charges of the lawyers. The Board Chairman wrote Torre to inform him that the bank had chosen the compassionate option of 'waiting' for Torre’s resignation. Torre was asked, without being dismissed, to turn over the documents of all cases handled by him to another official of the bank but Torre refused to resign and requested for a 'full hearing'. Days later, he reiterated his request for a 'full hearing', claiming that he had been 'constructively dismissed'. Moret assured Torre that he is 'free to remain in the employ of the bank' even if he has no particular work assignment. After another request for a 'full hearing' was ignored, Torre filed a complaint with the arbitration branch of NLRC for illegal dismissal. Reacting thereto, the bank terminated the services of Torre.

The case against Gatdula was then forwarded to him, and a re-investigation was conducted. The office of the Fiscal subsequently recommended dismissal. On January 11, 1966, the City Mayor returned the records of the case to the City Fiscal for the submission of an appropriate resolution but no resolution was submitted. On March 3,-1968, the City Fiscal transmitted the records to the City Mayor recommending that final action thereon be made by the City Board of Investigators (CBI). Although the CBI did not conduct an investigation, the records show that both the Municipal Board and the Fiscal’s Office exhaustively heard the case with both parties afforded ample opportunity to adduce their evidence and argue their cause. The Police Commission found Gatdula guilty on the basis of the records forwarded by the CBI. Gatdula challenged the adverse decision o'f the Police Commission theorizing that he was deprived of due process. Questions: Is the Police Commission bound by the findings of the City Fiscal? Is Gatdula’s protestation of lack or non- observance of due process well-grounded? Explain your answers. ",
        "Answer": "The Police Commission is not bound by the findings of the City Fiscal. In Mangubat v. de Castro, 163 SCRA 608, it was held that the Police Commission is not prohibited from making its own findings on the basis of its own evaluation of the records. Likewise, the protestation of lack of due process is not well-grounded, since the hearings before the Municipal Board and the City Fiscal offered Gatdula the chance to be heard. There is no denial of due process if the decision was rendered on the basis of evidence contained in the record and disclosed to the parties affect"

The crime is punishable with arresto mayor to prison correctional in its minimum period, or not to exceed 4 years and 2 months. The case was assigned to .Prosecutor Tristan and he applied Sec. 8(a) of Rule 112 which reads: '(a) If filed with the prosecutor.

Conrado, against whom a BP0 had been issued on petition of his wife, went to court to challenge the constitutionality of the law.

The city Mayor organized a task force which confiscated these materials. He then ordered that the materials be burned in public. Dominador, publisher of the magazine, 'Plaything', filed a suit, raising the following constitutional issues: (a) the confiscation of the materials constituted an illegal search and seizure, because the same was done without a valid search warrant and (b) the Confiscation, as well as the proposed destruction of the materials, is a denial of the right to disseminate information, and thus, violates the constitutional right to freedom of expression.

It cannot be justified as a valid warrantless search and seizure, because such search and seizure must have been an incident of a lawful arrest. There was no lawful arrest. (b) The argument of Dominador that pornographic materials are protected by the constitutional right to freedom of expression is erroneous, Obscenity is not protected expression.

Noticing that Ernesto is a minor, ,SP01 Jojo asked Ernesto to exhibit his driver's license but Ernesto failed to produce it. $1301 Jojo requested Ernesto to alight from the vehicle and the latter acceded. Upon observing a bulge in the pants of Ernesto, the policeman frisked him and found an unlicensed .22-caliber pistol inside Ernesto's right pocket. Ernesto was arrested, detained and charged. At the trial, Ernesto, through his lawyer, argued that, policemen at mobile checkpoints are empowered to conduct nothing more than a 'visual search'. They cannot order the persons riding the vehicle to alight. They cannot frisk, or conduct a body search of the driver or the passengers of the vehicle. Ernesto's lawyer this posited that: (A) The search conducted in violation of the Constitution and established jurisprudence was an illegal search; thus, the gun which was seized in the course of an illegal search is the 'fruit of the poisonous tree' and is inadmissible in evidence. ",
        "Answer": "The warrantless search of motor vehicles at checkpoints should be limited to a visual search. Its occupants should not be subjected to a body search. The 'stop and frisk rule' applies when a police officer observes suspicious activity or unusual activity which may lead him to believe that a criminal act may be afoot. The 'stop and frisk' is merely a limited protective search of outer clothing for weapons."

        "Question": "Around 12:00 midnight, a team of police officers was on routine patrol in Barangay Makatarungan when it noticed an open delivery van neatly covered with banana leaves. Believing that the van was loaded with contraband, the team leader flagged down the vehicle which was driven by Hades. He inquired from Hades what was loaded on the van. Hades just gave the police officer a blank stare and started to perspire profusely. The police officers then told Hades that they will look inside the vehicle. Hades did not make any reply. The police officers then lifted the banana leaves and saw several boxes. They opened the boxes and discovered several kilos of shabu inside. Hades was charged with illegal possession of illegal drugs.   After due proceedings, he was convicted by the trial court. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction. In his final bid for exoneration, Hades went to the Supreme Court claiming that his constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures was violated when the police officers searched his vehicle without a warrant; that the shabu confiscated from him is thus inadmissible in evidence; and that there being no evidence against him, he is entitled to an acquittal. For its part, the People of the Philippines maintains that the case of Hades involved a consented warrantless search which is legally recognized. The People adverts to the fact that Hades did not offer any protest when the police officers asked him if they could look inside the vehicle. Thus, any evidence obtained in the course thereof is admissible in evidence. Whose claim is correct? Explain.",
        "Answer": "The warrantless search was illegal. There was no probable cause to search the van. The shabu was not immediately apparent. It was discovered only after they opened the boxes. The mere passive silence of Hades did not constitute consent to the warrantless search."

Surveys Galore immediately assailed the show-cause order of Judge Assension, arguing that it is violative of the constitutional guaranty of freedom of expression. Is Surveys Galore’s petition meritorious? ",
        "Answer": "Yes. Surveys Galore’s petition is meritorious. Unwarranted attacks on the dignity of the courts cannot be disguised as free speech, for the exercise of said right cannot be used to impair the independence and efficiency of courts or public respect therefore and confidence therein . Without the sub judice rule and the contempt power, the courts will be powerless to protect their integrity and independence that are essential in the orderly and effective dispensation and administration of justice. This, of course, is not meant to stifle all forms of criticism against the court. As the third branch of the government, the courts remain accountable to the people. The peoples freedom to criticize the government includes the right to criticize the courts, their proceedings and decisions. This is the principle of open justice, which is fundamental to our democratic society and ensures that (a) there is a safeguard against judicial arbitrariness or idiosyncrasy, and that (b) the publics confidence in the administration of justice is maintained.[ The criticism must, however, be fair, made in good faith, and not spill over the walls of decency and propriety. And to enhance the open court principle and allow the people to make fair and reasoned criticism of the courts, the sub judice rule excludes from its coverage fair and accurate reports (without comment) of what have actually taken place in open court. In sum, the court, in a pending litigation, must be shielded from embarrassment or influence in its all-important duty of deciding the case. Any publication pending a suit, reflecting upon the court, the parties, the officers of the court, the counsel, etc., with reference to the suit, or tending to influence the decision of the controversy, is contempt of court and is punishable. The resulting (but temporary) curtailment of speech because of the sub judice rule is necessary and justified by the more compelling interests to uphold the rights of the accused and promote the fair and orderly administration of justice. However, in the cae of Surveys Galore there is no pending case before the court. Thus, the subjudice rule does not apply. Surveys Galore’s petition is meritorious."

Before the law could even be implemented, petitions were filed in the Supreme Court questioning said provisions by people who felt threatened, for themselves as well as for the benefit of others who may be similarly affected but not minded enough to challenge the law. The Solicitor General countered that there is no basis for the exercise of the power of judicial review since there has yet been no violation of the law, and therefore, there is no actual case or controversy to speak of, aside from the fact that the petitioners have no locus standi since they do not claim to be in imminent danger of being prosecuted under the law. Can the Court proceed to decide the case even if the law has not yet become effective? ",
        "Answer": "The Supreme Court can proceed to decide the case even if the law has not yet become effective. Since the petitions filed sought to nullify the Cybercrime Prevention Act, Because it violated several provisions of the Bill of Rights, the Supreme Court became duty-bound to settle the dispute. Since it is alleged that the Cybercrime Prevention Act violates various provisions of the Bill of Rights, including freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right against unreasonable searches and seizures, the issues raised are of paramount public interest of transcendental importance and with far-reaching constitutional implications that justify dispensation with locus standi and exercise of the power of judicial review by the Supreme Court. Jurisprudence provides that locus standi is not required when the action was filed to prevent a chilling effect on the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and overbreadth."

        "Question": "When is a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a law on the ground of violation of the Bill of Rights traditionally allowed? Explain your answer. ",
        "Answer": "In United States (US) constitutional law, a facial challenge, also known as a First Amendment Challenge, is one that is launched to assail the validity of statues concerning not only protected speech, but also all other rights in the First Amendment. This include religious freedom, freedom of the press, and the rights of the people to peaceably assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. After all, the fundamental right to religious freedom, freedom of the press and peaceful assembly are but component rights of the right to one’s freedom of expression, as they are modes which one’s thoughts are externalized. In this jurisdiction, the application of doctrines originating from the U.S. has been generally maintained, albeit with some modifications. While this Court has withheld the application of facial challenges to strictly penal statues, it has expanded its scope to cover statues not only regulating free speech, but also those involving religious freedom, and other fundamentals rights. The underlying reason for this modification is simple. For unlike its counterpart in the U.S., this Court, under its expanded jurisdiction, is mandated by the Fundamental Law not only to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, but also to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government."

The refusal of a teacher, student or pupil to attend or participate in the flag ceremony is a ground for dismissal after due investigation. The Secretary of Education, Culture and Sports issued a memorandum implementing said provision of law. As ordered, the flag ceremony would be held on Mondays at 7:30 a.m, during class days. A group of teachers, students and pupils requested the Secretary that they be exempted from attending the flag ceremony on the ground that attendance thereto was against their religious belief. The Secretary denied the request. The teachers, students and pupils concerned went to Court to have the memorandum circular declared null and void. Decide the case.",
        "Answer": "The teachers and the students should be exempted from the flag ceremony. As held in Ebrahnaq vs. Division Superintendent of Schools of Cebu. 251 SCRA 569, to compel them to participate in the flag ceremony will violate their freedom of religion. Freedom of religion cannot be impaired except upon the showing of a clear and present danger of a substantive evil which the State has a right to prevent.

One time, DeepThroat, an investigative reporter, made a research and study as to what the group’s leader, Maskeraid was actually doing. DeepThroat eventually came up with the conclusion that Maskeraid was a phony who is just fooling the simpleminded people to part with their money in exchange for the promise of eternal happiness in some far-away heaven. This was published in a newspaper which caused much agitation among the followers of Maskeraid. Some threatened violence against DeepThroat, while some others already started destroying properties while hurting those selling the newspaper. The local authorities, afraid of the public disorder that such followers might do, decided to ban the distribution of the newspaper containing the article. DeepThroat went to court complaining about the prohibition placed on the dissemination of his article. He claims that the act of the authorities partakes of the nature of heckler’s veto, thus a violation of the guaranty of press freedom. On the other hand, the authorities counter that the act was necessary to protect the public order and the greater interest of the community. If you were the judge, how would you resolve the issue? ",
        "Answer": "If I were the judge, I would rule that the distribution of the newspaper cannot be banned. Freedom of the news should be allowed although it induces a condition of unrest and stirs people to anger. Freedom of the press includes freedom of circulation. When governmental action that restricts freedom of the press is based on content, it is given the strictest scrutiny and the government must shoe that there is a clear and present danger of the substantive evil which the government has the right to prevent. The threats of violence and even the destruction of properties while hurting those selling the newspaper do not constitute a clear and present danger as to warrant curtailment of the right of Deep Throat to distribute the newspaper."

The government must show that its interests in promoting the efficiency of public services outweigh the employee's free speech and free exercise rights, which is a high bar for private social media posts."

        "Question": "A law provides that religious organizations are immune from suit for any torts committed by their employees. Is this law valid?",
        "Answer": "No, the law is likely invalid. Granting religious organizations blanket immunity from tort liability, where other organizations are not immune, violates the Establishment Clause by providing a special benefit to religion. It also potentially denies victims their right to access courts and seek redress, raising due process concerns."

        "Question": "A religious university that receives some state funding expels a student for violating its moral code based on religious doctrine. The student sues. Can the university be compelled to reinstate the student?",
        "Answer": "Generally, no. Courts grant significant deference to the decisions of religious educational institutions on matters of discipline related to their religious tenets. Compelling reinstatement would involve the court in interpreting religious doctrine, violating the Free Exercise Clause and the principle of church autonomy."

        "Question": "A city council opens its sessions with a prayer offered by a rotating group of clergy from different faiths. A citizen challenges this practice. Is the practice constitutional?",
        "Answer": "Yes, the practice is constitutional under the precedent set in *Town of Greece v. Galloway*. Legislative prayer is a historical tradition that does not violate the Establishment Clause, so long as the practice does not coerce participation and does not denigrate or proselytize non-adherents. A rotating roster of clergy from different faiths supports its neutrality."

        "Question": "A public hospital has a chaplaincy program funded by the government to provide spiritual comfort to patients. Is this program permissible?",
        "Answer": "The program may be permissible if it is administered neutrally. The government has a legitimate secular interest in addressing the holistic needs of patients, including spiritual care. However, the program must not favor one religion, must accommodate the requests of patients of all faiths or no faith, and must avoid coercing patients, to avoid violating the Establishment Clause."

        "Question": "A law prohibits all forms of religious proselytizing within 500 meters of any place of worship of another religion. A religious group challenges the law. What is the constitutional issue?",
        "Answer": "The law likely violates the Free Exercise and Free Speech clauses. It is a content-based restriction on religious speech that is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. While the government may have an interest in preventing religious disturbances, a blanket ban on proselytizing within a large radius is overly broad and suppresses core religious expression."

        "Question": "A public school district adopts a policy allowing student religious clubs to use school facilities for meetings during non-instructional time, on the same basis as other non-curricular student groups. A parent sues, claiming this violates the Establishment Clause. Is the policy constitutional?",
        "Answer": "Yes, the policy is constitutional under the Equal Access Act and relevant jurisprudence. If a public school creates a limited open forum for student-led non-curricular groups, it cannot discriminate against groups based on the religious content of their speech. The meetings must be student-initiated and student-led, and school officials may not be involved in the religious activities."

        "Answer": "No, this is likely unconstitutional. Requiring a public official to swear an oath including 'so help me God' violates the Establishment Clause by effectively imposing a religious test for public office. The government must provide a secular alternative oath that does not compel affirmation of a belief in God."

        "Answer": "The ordinance is likely unconstitutional. It constitutes a prior restraint on speech, particularly religious speech, and grants unbridled discretion to the mayor. Content-based restrictions on speech in a traditional public forum like sidewalks must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, which this ordinance fails to do."

        "Answer": "The law violates the Equal Protection Clause and likely the Establishment Clause. Creating a distinction based solely on the age of a religious organization is not substantially related to an important government interest and constitutes an arbitrary classification that favors established religions over newer ones."

        "Answer": "Yes, the university can generally accept and administer such a scholarship if the selection criteria are based on the donor's private choice and the university's administration is neutral. However, the university must ensure it does not appear to be endorsing the religion and that other scholarship opportunities remain available to all students regardless of religion."

        "Answer": "The court will apply the Sherbert/Yoder compelling state interest test. The ordinance substantially burdens the free exercise of religion. The government must show a compelling state interest in noise control and that the ordinance is the least restrictive means to achieve that interest. A total ban may not be the least restrictive means if limited noise regulations could suffice."

        "Answer": "Yes, this likely violates her Free Exercise rights. The government must show a compelling state interest for restricting religious expression, and merely having a policy against visible religious symbols without evidence of actual disruption to the educational process is insufficient. The teacher's private religious expression is protected unless it amounts to government endorsement of religion."

The textbooks must be the same as those used in public schools and cannot be used for religious instruction."

        "Answer": "The religious organization would likely lose the case. While religious freedom is protected, a business open to the public generally must comply with anti-discrimination laws. The government has a compelling interest in preventing discrimination in public accommodations, which outweighs the religious objection in this context."

        "Answer": "The ordinance violates the Equal Protection Clause and the Free Exercise Clause. It creates a content-based distinction that discriminates against religious speech and activity. The government must show a compelling interest for treating religious charities differently from secular ones, which would be difficult to establish here."

        "Answer": "This violates the Free Speech clause under the 'limited public forum' doctrine. Once a government entity opens its facilities for public use, it cannot discriminate against speech based on its religious content. The religious group must be given equal access to the facilities under the same terms as other community groups."

        "Answer": "The church could raise a Free Exercise defense, arguing that compliance with the building codes substantially burdens its religious exercise. However, the government would likely prevail as building safety codes serve a compelling government interest in public safety and are generally applicable laws that are neutral toward religion."

        "Answer": "This violates the religious group's freedom of expressive association and free exercise rights. Forcing a religious student organization to accept leaders who do not share its beliefs would fundamentally interfere with the group's ability to express its religious message and maintain its religious character."

        "Answer": "The display likely violates the Establishment Clause. A solitary nativity scene on government property constitutes an endorsement of Christianity. To be constitutional, religious displays must be part of a larger exhibit that includes secular holiday symbols, creating a context that shows the government is recognizing the holiday season rather than endorsing a particular religion."

        "Answer": "Yes, the government can impose such conditions. While religious schools have free exercise rights, when they accept government funds, the government may require that the funds not be used to support religious activities. This condition serves the compelling interest in preventing government funding of religion and is narrowly tailored to that purpose."

        "Answer": "This practice likely violates the Establishment Clause.

While religious beliefs are protected, when operating a for-profit business open to the public, the business must generally comply with neutral, generally applicable anti-discrimination laws.

        "Answer": "Yes, this is likely constitutional. A moment of silence is neutral in purpose and effect, serving both secular and religious purposes. It does not coerce students to pray and allows for individual choice. The inclusion of the word 'pray' does not invalidate the statute if the primary purpose is secular and it accommodates all students equally."

This constitutes unequal treatment and a substantial burden on religious exercise. The city must show a compelling government interest and that its zoning decision is the least restrictive means of achieving that interest."
